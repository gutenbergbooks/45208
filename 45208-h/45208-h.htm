  <h2 id='ch01' class='c004'>CHAPTER I<br /> <br />DAVID CHOOSES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>David Ellison would never forget his last
night at prep school. He had had a hard time
explaining to his three best friends that his
plans for college had failed. Lolling on the
grass in the pleasant June dusk, enjoying the
comfortable relaxation after the hectic hours
of Commencement Day, he had put off the evil
moment as long as he possibly could. Finally
he exploded his bomb.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, fellows,” he said, “I am not going to
college after all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a silence. Three pairs of eyes
regarded the speaker blankly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The heat,” said a tall boy in a hushed tone,
laying a hand on David’s unruly hair.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s that little girl he danced with four
times yesterday at the tea,” a second remarked
mournfully.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s because he leads the Honor Roll. He
thinks he knows it all now,” jeered the third;
then, “Kidding aside, Davie,” he said,
“what’s up?”</p>

<p class='c006'>David hesitated, then took the plunge.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Darn it!” he said. “Of course I owe it to
you three fellows to give you all the dope, but
I certainly hate to drag my affairs in. Still,
after all our planning I can’t leave you without
an explanation. You know I live in Denver
with my mother and two sisters. Boys,
I’ve got the finest mother, and the sweetest
kid sisters. Mother works. She never gets a
vacation; couldn’t even come to my Commencement.
Gosh! It made me sick. And
my older sister (she’s sixteen) has heard me
tell all about you fellows, and she was so crazy
to see you, and the school, and everything.
But they couldn’t make it. Too much car
fare.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, you big stiff!” cried the tall boy
angrily. “Why didn’t you say something?
Mother and father came right through Denver.
All your folks could have come on with
them in the car.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” said David, “I know, and I certainly
appreciate it, but they couldn’t very well—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But what about college, Dave?” asked the
tall boy impatiently.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll have to start away back,” said David.
“My father was an army officer—a captain in
the Air Corps. He went through the war
without a scratch until the day before the
Armistice. There was a big raid, and—well,
dad crashed. Shot down. He had nothing
but his pay, and only ten thousand dollars
war risk insurance. We were in Washington
when it happened. Mother took us back to
Denver, where she had some relatives, and invested
the insurance money in a little business.
She has a shop where she sells things
for women—a Specialty Shop, they call it.
She makes enough to keep herself and the
girls and give me just a little help once in a
while. I don’t know when I haven’t worked
at something to help pay my way and, as you
know, I’ve been lucky enough to meet all my
own expenses here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>David chuckled as his memory took him
back over the past four years. What hadn’t
he tackled! Band man, coach, bookkeeper,
tutor, telephone operator, handy man around
the house—anything and everything. He had
made his tuition and clothes, and hadn’t cost
his mother a cent. Of course, he had worked
summers too, but he had always found a job
near home so he could be near the family.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now as you know,” he continued, “I was all
set for college, with jobs enough cinched to
get me through all right, especially as I was to
share your quarters, but I have just found
out that the girls have given up their plans for
college, so that I can go! I had a letter from
my little sister, and she spilled the beans.
Poor kid, she didn’t know it! I’m going to
work; going to earn real money. There’s a
wholesale grocer in Denver who will give me
a job, I think.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But the big balloons, David; what about
them?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They will have to fly without yours truly.
Gosh! Well, I can always read about ’em;
that will be some comfort. And it takes quite
a knack to count bags of sugar.” He smiled
wryly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, we are all darned sorry,” said the
tall boy. “Guess you know that, Dave, without
our blubbering.”</p>

<p class='c006'>David got up.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I know it. But I’ve got to face hard
facts. Don’t think I’m squealing. Honest,
I’m glad to do it, even if it is disappointing.”
He squared his shoulders. “Well,” he said
reluctantly, “I’d better go by-by now; my
train leaves at six-thirty. I’ll stick my head
in your rooms on my way off. So long!”</p>

<p class='c006'>An hour later, sitting by his open window,
David listened to the strains of the band
over in the gymnasium and watched the stars.
He had the feeling that he was swinging in a
void. Every task and duty connected with
the school was finished. He had just jumped
on his trunk and locked it. It was ready to be
dragged out into the hall for the expressman
to take at dawn. Another boy was filling his
place in the band. Football, basketball, tennis—they
were all dreams, never to touch reality
again, even when he should look at the team
photographs cherished between stiff cardboards
in his trunk.</p>

<p class='c006'>A small apologetic rap sounded on his door.
No one ever knocked in the natural course of
events. Surprised, David opened it, snapping
on the light as he did so. The three boys stood
there, leaning heavily on one another’s shoulders.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hello!” said the foremost. “’Fraid you
would be in bed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, just picking up loose ends,” said David.
“Glad you happened along. Take an end of
this trunk, will you, and let’s heave it into the
hall.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What’s in it, bricks?” asked one, as they
placed the trunk in the corridor. They came
in, and shut the door.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I suppose you want to go to bed,” said the
tall boy, “but we have a plan to put up to you,
and we were afraid that there would be so
much confusion in the morning that you
might not see it straight. And I’m doing the
talking now, so you’ll kindly shut up until I
am all through. And be reasonable! Fact is,
old man, we want you to borrow the cost of
your college course from us. Now wait!” he
demanded, as David shook his head. “Try to
listen, you blithering idiot! We all have
plenty of money, and we want to stake you;
just as if you were our own brother, Dave.
Listen! It’s like this: take the money, and
keep the jobs you have planned on. They will
float you, and you can send the cash home, and
the girls can go to college, and everything will
be jake. See?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can’t take it,” said David, touched and
amused at the same time. “If that is what
brought you, just save your breath. You are
the best friends a fellow ever had, and it is
worth giving up more than I have given up to
find it out. But I don’t want your money. I
can’t take anybody’s money. I haven’t a cent
of my own beside my car fare and ten dollars
for meals, and I am going to start square with
myself and the whole world.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Get this, fellows; I am just as grateful as I
can be, and I’ll never forget it. But I’m not
going to be carried along by my friends. I
won’t be a sap, or a sucker, or a leech. I’ll
work my own way up, and boy! just watch my
dust!” He shook each one by the hand and
somehow, before they knew it, they were in
the hall.</p>

<p class='c006'>Davie, ready for bed, tired with their kindly
insistence, wondered if they would come in the
night, and pin large checks on his pajama
coat!</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I won’t borrow, and I won’t sponge
on my mother,” David declared grimly
to himself. “I’ll show what I can do. I won’t
be carried along. I’ll arrive somewhere, some
day, on my own two feet, and not on the
shoulders of somebody else. I’ll make those
fellows darned proud of me yet!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Outside David’s door lay his boyhood, his
flaming hopes, his fondest memories. All his
life he had meant to be an aviator. He had
thought of it, studied for it, and concentrated
on it; but his skies were empty now. No majestic
forms floated grandly across his horizon.
Vanished were the dream-ships which
he had meant to make real. Gone were his
shining hopes, his resolves to follow in his
father’s footsteps. Not for him, in future
days, to build ships such as the world had
never seen. He determined to destroy all the
careful plans and experiments he had so
neatly drawn. In the bottom of his trunk
were a score of technical books on dirigibles,
past and present, bought at long intervals
with hard-earned money. For it was the
dirigible toward which David’s heart yearned.
The great majestic balloons held a charm for
him that the busy, flitting airplanes were
powerless to wield. But he knew that he had
made the right decision; and knowing it, slept
well.</p>

<p class='c006'>Reaching home, it took much argument on
David’s part before his adoring family was
resigned to his change of plans; but he was all
the more determined when he saw how worn
his mother’s still lovely face had grown.</p>

<p class='c006'>His friend the wholesale grocer was away.
However, the manager said that he would be
back in a few days and assured David that a
good job was waiting for him. On the long,
tedious trolley ride home, David had time to
think. At school, he could always hop some
fellow’s car. Easy and pleasant. He’d never
given it a thought, but that was sponging in a
way. Well, never again; never! He made a
wry face at a cat on a gatepost. Lord! he was
slated to be poor—filthy poor, for many a long
year. It couldn’t be too many years, though.</p>

<p class='c006'>He must make money. His mother didn’t
look right. Of course, the wholesale groceries
might give him a good break. Lots of fellows
had begun at the very bottom and had
soared up.</p>

<p class='c006'>Soared—that brought his mind to the ships
again. It would always be like that, he knew.
He’d go along, almost contented, working like
the devil and getting on in groceries, but underneath
he’d always be thinking about the
ships, the roar of the engines, the feel of the
rushing air. And he couldn’t do that—not if
he meant to make a good grocer. A good
grocer! Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord! Something
would have to be done!</p>

<p class='c006'>By the time he reached home the pendulum
had swung again. He couldn’t give up his
ships. Why, he was kin to every dirigible,
every balloon, every little fat blimp that adventured
into the upper tides! He couldn’t
give them up. As well ask a sailor to go inland
and hoe turnips. As well ask a violinist to
drive rivets for a living. Well, he’d hoe turnips,
drive rivets; hoe fast and drive hard.
He was no shirk.</p>

<p class='c006'>Quite simply and trustingly, David turned
to that Great Source upon whom strong hearts
are not ashamed to call. “Help me to find a
way!” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c006'>After dinner, while turning the pages of a
magazine David chanced on an article on
dirigibles. He commenced to read it. Parts
of it he reread, scarcely believing his eyes.
He gave a whoop of delight.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The very thing!” he cried. “Mother, listen
to this!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is it?” cried Mrs. Ellison and his
older sister Lydia.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Something big! Just listen!” David’s face
glowed with excitement. “Today I went over
to Black &amp; Black’s to see about a job. They
will take me on at fifteen bucks a week, and a
chance for a raise occasionally. But they
wouldn’t sign me on today because the Mr.
Black who attends to such things is away,
thank goodness!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why ‘thank goodness’?” said Lydia.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This magazine says Goodlow &amp; Company,
at Ayre, Ohio, have expanded into the
largest dirigible works in the world; and
owing to the necessity of having expert
pilots and mechanics, they are about to open
a school for novices. It is a four-year course,
in four departments. First year, ground
work; second year, construction and development;
third year, balloon fabrics and gases;
and fourth year, intensive piloting.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Some rich guy has already posted a big
prize to be competed for by the students, for
the best invention that will add to the safety
of dirigible navigation. And there is a prize
in each department given at the close of each
year, for the student who has done the best
work. They will accept only a limited number
of students, and what do you know about
this? They pay ’em real money, with bigger
salaries, of course, as they go along.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, they couldn’t afford to do that, could
they, David?” inquired his mother.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, because the students are at first really
laborers and then mechanics in a small way—apprentices
to the real big fellows until they
acquire skill themselves. Mother, if I can
make it, it will fix everything. The students
have their quarters at the plant; dormitories,
I suppose. It is rather like being in the army.
Pretty stiff discipline, and all that. There
won’t be any expenses to speak of, and I can
send home almost every cent they give me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But flying, Davie!” said Mrs. Ellison, her
beautiful soft eyes filled with tears. “Flying!
I have hoped so that you wouldn’t fly.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mother darling,” said David gently, “I
know how you must feel, but this is not war
time. It is peace that needs the dirigible. It
is the greatest invention; the greatest—Oh, I
am crazy about it! Father would tell me to
go on, wouldn’t he, mother?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, he would indeed,” Mrs. Ellison said
proudly, with a tremulous smile.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When do you have to start, Davie?” asked
his younger sister, Patty.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Patty seems to have decided it,” laughed
Mrs. Ellison.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The examinations for enrollment are only
four days from today,” said David ruefully.</p>

<p class='c006'>“At Ayre, Ohio!” cried Lydia. “My goodness!
Dave, you will have to start tonight.
And what will you start on? Has anybody
got any money?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have the Liberty Bond father bought
me,” said David.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mrs. Ellison’s eyes filled, but Lydia jumped
up and danced around the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The very thing!” she cried. “Oh, that’s
wonderful! Father would so love to stake you
in this. Come on, mother, get out his bond,
and while you and David go out and get somebody
to cash it, I will pack his things, and see
to reservations.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She looked at her mother, and sensed something
wrong.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You approve, don’t you, mother? You will
let him fly? We will be so proud of him. Why,
this is better than a dozen colleges.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A school for apprentices,” mused Mrs. Ellison.
“That really means greater safety for
future ships, doesn’t it? It is a wonderful
thing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is not a new idea,” said David. “They
opened one in Friedrichshafen, Germany,
during the war. It has been a great success.
Friedrichshafen is the cradle of the dirigible.
We have army and navy schools here in this
country, but this school is to fit civilians for
commercial flying, and is run on what you
might call a co-operative basis. I wondered
if we would ever wake up over here to the
necessity of schools like that. And now—well,
I bet in three or four years there will be a
dozen schools scattered all over the United
States.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dave, it’s just great!” cried Lydia.</p>

<p class='c006'>David looked anxiously toward his mother.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, what’s the good word, mother? Do
I go?”</p>

<p class='c006'>For a long moment Mrs. Ellison seemed lost
in thought. This boy was her only son. How
much safer it would be to “measure coffee,
and count sugar sacks.” Her only son; but
he was his father’s son as well! Brave, intrepid
Rick Ellison had a share in this boy.
So she spoke for them both, and smiled.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Go, of course, David,” she said.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch02' class='c007'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />LORD CRAM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>David found the trip to Ayre tedious; the
hours dragged interminably. His first night
was sleepless, and he went into the dining-car
for breakfast rather late. He slipped into an
empty seat at one of the small tables for two.
He found himself seated across from a thin,
dark young man a little older than himself.
His pleasant good-morning was returned by
a mumbled greeting as the stranger glanced
up, then hurriedly transferred his attention
to his food. He ate importantly, seeming to
put a vast amount of ceremony into the
homely order of bacon and eggs before him.</p>

<p class='c006'>David ordered breakfast, and commenced
to study his time-table. When he laid it down,
the stranger leaned across and remarked, “I
meant to get a time-table and forgot it. May
I see yours?”</p>

<p class='c006'>David handed it over with a pleasant word.
The stranger, swaying to the motion of the
fast train, opened the folder. David had
marked stops and changes, and had drawn a
black line around Ayre. The chap looked up,
and caught David’s eye.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ayre your destination?” he asked, and at
David’s nod he continued, “That’s where I am
going, too. My name is Cram—Walter Cram.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My name is Ellison,” said David, “Glad
to meet you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ellison,” said Walter Cram. “Not a very—well,
I don’t know any Ellison, myself.
Never heard the name but once. I’ve got a
book, ‘Great Pilots of the World War.’ There
is a pilot in that book named Ellison. A great
chap; absolutely fearless; did the most amazing
things. His career reads like a fairy story.
You ought to get that book and read about
him. It would interest you on account of the
coincidence of the name.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I expect it would,” said David.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cram, once started, chatted on. He ran an
appraising eye over David’s neat but not new
suit, his correct but worn hat, his well-kept
but muscular hands. He pulled out a watch,
white gold, thin and racy-looking in its general
correctness.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What time you got?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>David, with a smile, obligingly bit. He
hauled out a large fat silver timepiece on the
turnip order, and gravely offered its moon
face for Cram’s inspection.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Heirloom?” asked Cram compassionately.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My grandfather’s,” replied David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How the old fellows loved those turnips!”
said Cram. “I had an old hick of a grandfather,
a farmer out in the sticks. He had one
of those, and we couldn’t make him give it up.
Same with yours, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, he wouldn’t give it up,” said David.
“Used it all his life, then gave it to me.” What
use to tell Cram how that watch had been carried
by its intrepid owner into Africa, and
through the jungles of South America? It
had lived in China, had skirted the steppes of
Russia, had been shipwrecked, and shot at.
The dent on its fat back was the mark of a
poisoned arrow in Australia. No, his grandfather
had never given it up until, called at
last to explore a far more distant and unknown
country, his dying hand had pressed it
into the baby grasp of his grandson.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sentiment is a blamed poor thing,” Cram
declared; then, as if he had been too friendly,
he rose abruptly, nodded and with a brief “See
you later,” went off, carrying the newspaper,
and David’s time-table as well.</p>

<p class='c006'>With a sigh of relief, David tackled his
bacon and eggs, and a second man slid into the
vacant seat. He looked directly at David with
a pair of keen blue eyes, around which curled
thick fair lashes. His shock of reddish-gold
hair had been struggled with, but not subdued.
His wide grin disclosed dazzling white teeth,
whiter by contrast with the deep sunburn of
his skin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mind if I sit here, Buddy?” he asked cheerily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not a bit,” said David, smiling in return.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Name’s Ryan,” said the blond husky.
“Kenneth Ryan.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m David Ellison,” said David, warming
at once to the honest face and clear gaze.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Glad to meet you,” said Ryan, extending
his hard and muscular hand. He studied the
menu card anxiously. “These here mennoos!”
he groaned. “What makes ’em have so many
things to pick from? When I’m home I eat at
delicatessens, or Childs’; but this! Damfino
what to choose!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I had oatmeal, and bacon and eggs, and
cakes,” said David helpfully.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bully!” said Ryan. He looked up at the
waiter. “The same,” he said, waving a comprehensive
hand toward David’s place. Then
he settled his elbows on the table.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I seen you talking to Lord Cram,” he
chuckled.</p>

<p class='c006'>“For a few minutes,” said David. “You
know him?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yeah, but he doesn’t know me, now. I used
to go to school with him when we were kids at
St. Mary’s school in Lawton, Oklahoma. His
folks couldn’t send him to public school on account
of the Mex and Indians fightin’ him so
because of the way he yelled. Beat any Indian
war cry you ever heard. Then his grandfather
struck oil on his worthless farm, and,
lordymighty, the Crams just soared! No, he
don’t know me. I’m just a mechanic. How
far are you going, if you don’t mind me
asking?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ayre, Ohio,” said David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ayre!” said Ryan. “Why, that’s where
Cram is bound. That’s funny! By golly, I bet
you are both set to try that examination at the
Goodlow Plant.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am, at any rate,” said David. “I don’t
know about Cram. He didn’t put out any information.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Afraid you might cramp his style. That’s
him all over. You might jump off the train
ahead of him, and get the first taxi, and reach
the plant first, and grab off a job as vice
president.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Are you going there, too?” asked David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I am, as it happens, but not for that
apprentice course, worse luck. I haven’t
enough education. I want to land a job as mechanic.
I just can’t keep away from the flying
machines, Ellison, and,” he added, thrusting
out a stubborn jaw, “if I get a chance down at
Goodlow’s, I’ll bet my bottom dollar that I will
make a swell mechanic. I’ve nothing at all
above the collar,” he grinned, “but I own a
damn good pair of hands.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You will do,” laughed David. “Here’s hoping
we both get in. We’ll see something of
each other if we do. I’ve got to write a note
to my mother; see you later.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sure, sure!” said Ryan, beaming. “I camp
in the smoker. So long!”</p>

<p class='c006'>He watched David leave the car.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, Red, we like that bozo, don’t we?” he
told himself. “True blue, if I can read a man,
and a gentleman born. As my mother says,
the mark of character shows on a man, no
matter how many overcoats he wears.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Later, in the club car, David found Cram
reading a magazine. He walked up to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You forgot to return my time-table, I
think,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Time-table? Oh, yes, here it is. I did take
it, didn’t I? Sorry, and thanks.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s all right,” said David, turning.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wait!” Cram exclaimed. “Sit down. I’d
like to talk to you. I am wondering if you are
going to Ayre.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think it is marked on my time-table,” returned
David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I noticed it. It doesn’t happen that you are
going down for the examinations at Goodlow’s,
does it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“On account of my name being the same as
an aviator?” laughed David. “As a matter of
fact, I am going for the exams.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Cram shook his head. “That’s almost too
bad,” he said. “You’ve come a long way, but
I’m afraid you won’t have the ghost of a
chance, unless you brought a lot of credentials,
letters from your teachers, and congressmen,
and senators, and so on. No? Well,
they tell me it is going to take a lot of pull to
get in, a darned lot of pull. You see, these
people want to interest influence and money,
and they are going to give first chance to the
applicants who can do ’em the most good that
way.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s too bad,” said David, without showing
any particular anxiety. “I can’t show a
letter from a single senator. I had an idea
that this was strictly a personal merit proposition.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Personal merit hasn’t a show these days,
my boy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What pull have you got?” asked David.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cram put a hand on David’s knee.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Boy, I have a suitcase stuffed full of credentials.
I have enough to paper a room! No
need to worry over my chances.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s fine,” said David heartily. “I will
have to depend on school reports, and such
things.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He nodded, and walked away. He was depressed
in spite of himself. The cocksure
arrogance of Cram was funny, yet it stuck in
David’s mind. He was glad to wander into
the smoker and talk to Ryan, who greeted
him joyfully. He repeated his conversation
with Cram.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Aw, he makes me sick!” scoffed Ryan. “He
may make the grade, at that, though. He got
to be quite a shark at his books, and he’s had
a small plane, so he can talk smooth and easy.
Yeah, he may pass. Lots of ways he’s not so
bad. My brother Mike likes him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have a brother?” asked David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Six,” said Ryan. “Have you any?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Six? Gosh! No; I have two sisters.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Only two? I have five. That’s quite a
houseful to bring up and dress and feed, even
in Oklahoma. No wonder we boys worked.
But it did us good, at that. I don’t begrudge
any of it, except I was sorry that I
never could get the hang of my lessons. Some
of us is smart, though. My oldest brother was
a chaplain in the army through the war. I
wanted to enlist last year, and told him so;
and he said, ‘Red Ryan, you no-account, if you
go enlistin’ in the army for thirty a month
and found, I’ll find ye and I’ll not leave one
strip of skin on your back, and the Pope and
me will excommunicate you beside.’ He’s a
murderin’ cuss. I’m not one to butt into your
affairs, Mr. Ellison, but don’t you give Wally
one worrisome thought. You’ll pass. I like
your straight-looking eyes, and so will they.”</p>

<p class='c006'>David laughed. “Why, you fuss me, Ryan,”
he said, “but I am going to get in. I have got
to pass; and if I fail this time, I’ll get work
with you, and study nights, and try for the
next class.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s the stuff, me lad!” cried the redhead.
“Not climbing up on nobody’s shoulders.
And Red Ryan’s the lad that’s going to
stand by and hurray when you’ve got where
you’re goin’.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But five days later, at the Goodlow Plant in
Ayre, David did pass. As anticipated, there
was a mob of applicants. Scores of them, who
saw in flying an easy way of escaping the
grind of ordinary toil. These soon faded out
of the picture, when they found out a little of
the requirements and routine of the strenuous
years ahead, and left a few real enthusiasts,
boys who realized that aviation is humanity’s
dream come true.</p>

<p class='c006'>How can we guess what hours the cave man
spent, after a kill and its resultant feast, lying
on some mossy bank, watching the swift and
glorious flight of great birds, and longing to
be as they? Then, ages passing, the vision persisted
with the winged beasts of the Apocalypse;
the flying steeds of Zeus; Pegasus,
beautiful and free, winging his glorious way
toward the dawn, outracing the Flying Carpet;
eager young Icarus, his wings of wax
melting in the sun. Ever aspiring, the
dreamers passed, laughing at Darius Green
as he tumbled, and watching with bated
breath as the first hot-air balloons lumbered
clumsily into the air! An age-old dream that
has never grown less alluring, never less
lovely, but depends at last on man’s own
knowledge and desperate endeavor.</p>

<p class='c006'>So, in the big austere room, where the Board
of Judges met, the stream of applicants slowly
divided, one part to be absorbed again into
the arteries of the cities, the other part to face
the final questions and scrutiny of men well
able to judge men’s capabilities, and read their
secret ambitions.</p>

<p class='c006'>They were questioned in small groups; and
David, when dismissed with a number of
others with the welcome assurance that they
would be enrolled as student apprentices, was
unaware of the good impression he had made
on the examining board. As he was about to
leave the room, someone at his elbow called
his name. A tall gray-haired man stood beside
him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Are you Rick Ellison’s son?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, yes, sir,” said David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am Colonel Porter. I am very proud to
have known your father. He was an ace of
aces. His death, coming at that last moment
of the war, was doubly a tragedy and a great
loss to the air service. You have something
to live up to, young man.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am proud, Colonel, but if you don’t mind—well,
sir, would you mind doing me a
favor?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Name it, son!” said the Colonel. “Doing a
favor for Rick Ellison’s boy would seem like
doing something for him; and God knows anyone
who knew him would jump at that chance.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is only this,” said David. “If you don’t
mind, I’d rather not have it known here about
father. He is too big for me. I want to see if
I can’t make good without leaning on his record.
If it leaks out now that I am Captain
Ellison’s son, lots of ’em will watch me and
perhaps be kinder to me than I deserve.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t you see, sir, it is sort of like the ginks
in old times, who used to go out to kill dragons
and rescue fair ladies carrying plain shields,
so nobody would know that their fathers were
kings, until they had proved that they were
pretty hot themselves.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Absolutely; you are right!” said the
Colonel. “I will not tell, but don’t forget that
I am David Ellison’s friend, for his own sake
as well as for the sake of his father.” He
shook David’s hand and as the boy went out
muttered to himself, “Damned if that kid
hasn’t killed his first dragon, already; the
dragon of dependence!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Once outside, David sprinted for a telegraph
office, and the glorious news of his success
ticked gaily off to his mother. Then taking
his suitcase, he returned to the Goodlow
Plant, and at the barracks was assigned his
quarters.</p>

<p class='c006'>On his way to find Ryan he saw Cram sitting
outside the General Offices, where the
Board was working.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What’s the glad news, Cram?” he cried.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cram looked up.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, there’s some hitch,” he said. “I guess
they don’t know just which class to put me in.
They told me to wait until afternoon. I
thought I might as well stay right here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did they read all your dope?” asked David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They have it in there,” said Cram. “I’ll bet
it knocks ’em cold. I told ’em all I could, but
it was such a scramble. I don’t believe I
touched on the oil. Ready money, Ellison. A
few family gushers to put into improvements
and all that. Yes, I ought to have mentioned
the oil.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I bet the oil will leak out sooner or
later,” said David. “Good luck!” He went on.</p>

<p class='c006'>Two hours later as David skirted the big
landing field, he saw Cram, suitcase in hand,
hurrying toward the taxi stand. David
shouted, but he did not appear to hear. Breaking
into a run, David overtook him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What’s the decision?” he enquired.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cram’s face was livid; his lips twitched.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ellison, they turned me down!” he announced.
“Said I wasn’t scholastically and
technically qualified. Politics in it somehow,
of course. Or some personal grudge.” He
swore roundly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, that’s too bad!” said David. The
other’s bitter disappointment roused a feeling
of friendship that surprised him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll get even somehow,” said the other.
“Why, all I wanted was to make a name for
myself in something beside oil.” His eyes
filled.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, that’s all right. You study, and come
back next year, and try again. If you want
any help or suggestions, write me. I’ll do
what I can.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Cram did not reply at once. He smoothed
his ruffled hair with a hand that shook.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I guess I’m like our Indians. Some
grudges I never forget.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Be a good Indian then, Cram, and don’t
tomahawk anybody until you know just
what’s what.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Cram sneered, and with a glare over David’s
shoulder walked hastily away. David turned
to see the cause of the venomous look. It was
Red Ryan, whistling lustily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Red, they kicked him out,” said David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not Cram!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yep, and gosh, he is sore! Wants to kill
someone. Wants to be a bad Indian, in fact.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Cram kicked out—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not really kicked,” said David. He repeated
Cram’s report.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He’ll consider he’s been dynamited. Well,
with my brother a priest, I’d do better not to
rejoice as I could. But if he’s gone, he’s gone,
and we’ve new jobs, and tough ones ahead
of us.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c007'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br />THE SILVER SHIP</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>For nearly four years David had been an
apprentice-student at the Lighter-than-Air
School at Goodlow Field. During that time
many changes had taken place. The school,
at first housed in a single building on the
Goodlow property, now had commodious
brick buildings for classrooms, laboratories
and dormitories. The school was run on an
original scheme, which had proved most successful.
It was co-operative. The students
received free tuition and a small salary, in return
for which they gave their labor. Any
student falling below a certain grade was immediately
dismissed.</p>

<p class='c006'>This benevolent scheme of education was
made possible by the kindness of one of America’s
greatest philanthropists, Mr. John Harrison
Hammond, who added the strength of
his millions to the Goodlow holdings at Ayre.</p>

<p class='c006'>The erection of the great new hangar, or
dock, was a story in itself. Even in this day
of architectural and engineering miracles, the
building was unbelievably huge. It was the
largest airport factory and dock in the world.
Its floor was a vast concrete spread, the
largest uninterrupted floor area yet built.
Over this rose the dock structure, a cavernous
semi-paraboloid building. From the passing
airplane, it looked like a peanut or a silkworm
cocoon. It was lighted with tier after
tier of glass, in steel frames, so precisely
made that a push-button controlled whole
units of windows. The enormous doors, two-thirds
glass, slid on ball-bearing wheels along
tracks imbedded in the floor. These, too, were
operated by a one-man lever.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the top of the arching roof was tackle to
hold the dirigibles during construction. Here
swung the great shapes slowly evolving from
ghostly skeletons to the finished marvels
ready for flight. There was space for the
construction of two ships at the same time.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ship that hung there partly finished
was the largest yet built. Perfect in line, and
carrying many new features; as yet unnamed,
her career undecided, she drew David like a
magnet. She was his dream ship, at last come
true.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the back of the dock built into the wall
was a row of offices for the executives. The
central office belonged to Colonel Porter, A. C.,
U. S. A. retired, Commandant of the school
and chief of the dock forces. Colonel Porter
was a lifelong friend of Mr. Hammond, and
his influence had persuaded the great financier
to put his personal energy and many millions
of his vast fortune into the great task
of today—the development of aviation.</p>

<p class='c006'>One morning late in May, the two friends
sat in Colonel Porter’s office.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I hardly expected you so soon,” said
Colonel Porter.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, Port, I’ve decided to spend the rest
of my life around the ships. I like it. I’m not
young, but my money can do the hard work.
I’m inclined to help you push this business as
far as it will go.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Exactly what I hoped you would decide to
do!” exclaimed the Colonel. “And you have
already made a wonderful start. This ship
you are financing—you would be surprised at
the callers she has had; people from all over
the world, looking her over, taking snapshots
of her, writing down her dimensions. We
could sell her tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have any changes been made recently?”
asked Mr. Hammond.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not a thing,” said Colonel Porter. “Here
are the original specifications.” He hunted
up a long sheet of paper.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never mind the figures,” said Mr. Hammond
hastily. “My clipping agency sends me
about two a day, usually different, but they
all agree that she contains ten million, two
hundred thousand cubic feet and is twelve
stories high amidship. You know that item
seems to make a great hit with the public.
What will her lifting power be, Port?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, hydrogen gives us eighty pounds to
the thousand feet, and helium sixty pounds
to the thousand. That works out to eight
hundred thousand pounds. You can depend
on four hundred tons of useful lift.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gosh, that sounds like a lot!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s handy to have.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It does seem, Port, as though we ought to
make more than seventy-five miles an hour
with those five huge engines.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It can’t be done, Harry. Not with a ship
that size.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did you decide to use the new weave of
linen cloth for the covering?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, it is a great improvement. And the
new style seam-lacings hold perfectly. What
are you going to name the ship, by the way?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I selected half a dozen names that sounded
good to me,” said Mr. Hammond. “Hammond
High-flyer, Harkaway, and some others, but
daughter Dulcie objected. Made such a fuss
that I said she could name it herself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What were her contributions?” asked
Colonel Porter with a smile. He knew Dulcie
Hammond.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She didn’t bother with a choice. She says
the ship is named Moonbeam.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is a splendid name. Harry, you don’t
know how fine that ship is going to be. She
will be the most beautiful ship in the air.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I want her to be,” said Mr. Hammond with
a dogged, grim look that Colonel Porter knew
of old. “I am planning to show that ship to
the world, Port. She has got to be perfect.
What do you think of following the course of
the Graf Zeppelin, for a starter, and beating
the G. Z.’s time?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Colonel Porter whistled.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think it would be all right. Her maiden
flight, eh? I wonder if she can do it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing like trying, is there? When will
she be ready to fly?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Colonel Porter reflected.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She will be finished about the first of June.
Then she must make some trial flights. You
can take off by the fourteenth or fifteenth.
You will go, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You bet! I’m commander of that ship.
And I want you to pick out a few of the students,
all grades, for staff. I think it would
be a wonderful try-out for them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll do it,” said Colonel Porter with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why don’t you come along, Port? You
need a rest.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Colonel Porter groaned.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Rest? Why, Harry, we are simply
swamped with work. I couldn’t possibly get
away.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wish you could,” said Mr. Hammond, and
was silent a few moments. “Those gas bags,”
he continued, following the train of his
thought, “they are absolutely impervious to
any kind of gas, aren’t they?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Absolutely, when made of the substance
we call, for lack of a better name, gold-beater’s
skin. You know gold-beaters beat
their gold into the tissue-like sheets used by
the trade, by putting it between layers of
the split and cleansed intestines of the ox,
and pounding it. For the gas bags, they
split and clean the intestines, and lay them
out with overlapping edges. Others are laid
on top, at right angles. These congeal into
a mass of fabric, which is flexible, yet perfectly
impervious.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It certainly beats all,” said Mr. Hammond.
“By the way, Port, whom shall I take on as
captain? Got a good man?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The best!” said Colonel Porter heartily.
“A man named Fraine. Captain Fraine is as
good a man as flies. During the war he was
shot down and badly wounded, and wears a
small silver plate on his head. He has been
with us for six years. I advise Fraine.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“All right; whatever you say goes. Just
give me a good staff and a good crew.” Mr.
Hammond rose and stretched his great
shoulders. “Let’s go look at the Moonbeam.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The following day Mr. Hammond flew down
to New York, but a telegram from Colonel
Porter brought him back on the first of June.
He found the Moonbeam lowered and workmen
putting the final touches on her passenger
gondola, establishing the monstrous engines
in the five “eggs” that were waiting for them,
and varnishing the propellers with the hardest,
smoothest spar varnish, to reduce friction.
The seam-lacings had been tightened,
and the linen cover looked as pale and smooth
as aluminum. Men were painting the window
casings of the gondola, others were testing
the screws and bolts holding the ladders leading
from the five eggs into the hull.</p>

<p class='c006'>Beneath the ship, groups of sightseers
moved slowly. They came in chatting shrilly
after the manner of the Great American
Tourist, but the immensity of the dock and
the sight of the vast silver ship, so quiescent
in the hands of her makers, seemed to quell
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond and Colonel Porter entered
the ship through the door in the center of the
right side of the passenger gondola. From the
doorway, they walked straight ahead along a
short passage to the center of the gondola,
where they turned to the right, along another
passage into the control room. This spacious
room occupied the whole forward end of the
gondola. The oval front was composed entirely
of windows, through which the officer
at the wheel had an unobstructed view.</p>

<p class='c006'>Leaving the control room, the first room on
the right was the chart room, a small cubicle
fitted with drawers and filing cases. Opposite
this was the navigator’s room. Directly back
of this was the galley, a small but perfect
kitchen, where every inch of space was utilized
by the latest electrical cooking utensils.
The very sight of the wealth of pots and pans,
the roasters, broilers, frying baskets and
toasters made Mr. Hammond rub his hands
delightedly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Colonel Porter managed to get Mr. Hammond
away from the galley, and they went
directly across the passage into the radio
room.</p>

<p class='c006'>The salon came next. This room was dining-room
and lounge in one. It filled the breadth
of the gondola, and had six broad windows
that gave ample space for observation. There
were six extension tables, chairs, a couple of
divans, and a desk. The chair covers, window
curtains and walls were bright with French
flowered chintz. It was as gay and luxurious
as a private yacht.</p>

<p class='c006'>Back of this room, with a passage between,
were the staterooms; six on each side, with
double-decked bunks. These cabins were
equipped with every luxury to be found on an
ocean liner.</p>

<p class='c006'>Behind the staterooms, one on either side of
the passage, were the wash-rooms, beautifully
equipped, one for men and one for women
passengers. Everything in the passenger
gondola was as near perfect as modern appliances
and human ingenuity could make it.</p>

<p class='c006'>They walked back to the radio room, in a
corner of which a steel ladder led up into the
hull. There they inspected the quarters of the
officers and crew; plainer but just as comfortable
as those down below. Mr. Hammond,
notwithstanding his size, was well muscled
and agile. He followed Colonel Porter along
the catwalks, among the fuel tanks, and then
up the many ladders to the observer’s
platform, where they lifted the trap and
stepped out on the very top of the ship.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This dock is certainly a big place,” said Mr.
Hammond, staring about.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” replied Colonel Porter. “It is hard
to realize its size. You can give its footage,
twelve hundred feet long, three hundred and
twenty-five feet wide, and two hundred and
four feet high, but that doesn’t convey much.
But pause to remember that if it was placed in
front of the national Capitol at Washington,
it would hide the entire building except a little
bit of the spire. Or you could lay the Woolworth
building and Washington monument
down in it, side by side, and almost lose them.
Or you could stage ten full-sized football
games in it at the same time, and still have
plenty of room to spare.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They made their way down through the hull
to the gondola, where workmen were now busy
putting on electric light fixtures, and went
back to Colonel Porter’s office.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c007'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />ASSISTANT PILOT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A small and well-worn automobile was
parked near the great hangar on the Goodlow
lot. On the bent and sagging running board
sat its owners, David Ellison and Red Ryan.
Over three years had passed since the day
David had been enrolled as a student in the
Goodlow school for apprentices; three years
of hard and often discouraging work, but the
work had developed him. He was no longer
a diffident boy. Manhood sat easily on his
broad shoulders. Looking at him, Red Ryan’s
honest and loyal heart swelled with pride. He
wondered if David had the least idea of his
own success. Ryan knew—knew what the
other fellows were saying, knew how the officers
and pilots talked sometimes, while they
stood watching his trained fingers making
magical repairs on some weak or broken part.
It never occurred to Red that his own uncanny
cleverness had set him apart as the best mechanic
on the lot. His thought was all for
David—David, only twenty-two, and gosh-a-mighty,
what he didn’t know about dirigibles!
What he hadn’t already done with ’em!</p>

<p class='c006'>Right now David was gazing lovingly
through the open doors of the hangar at the
vast silver shape rapidly approaching perfection
and completion under the hands of its
pygmy workmen. The vastness of the place,
and the ship’s tremendous bulk seemed to
deaden the noise of hammers and bolts. She
seemed to float there in the hangar. To David
she seemed already restless to be away. He
imagined a ripple of light down her silver
side; a stir, as though she could no longer
wait, but would break away and slip through
the great door to be off alone into the infinite
troubled tides of the sky.</p>

<p class='c006'>Red followed David’s entranced look.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ain’t she the cat’s whiskers, just?” he enquired
lovingly. “Say, if she makes good on
her trial flight, I’m just goin’ to lay right
down there, front of everybody, and cry, or
pray, or swear, I dunno which.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A little of each, perhaps,” said David, snapping
out of his dream. “I’ll be right with you,
bully boy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You know, David, they have told you off
to do a lot of important work on that ship. I
don’t believe you appreciate the fact. All the
fellows are talking about it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Applesauce!” David retorted, laughing.
“Everyone in the senior class has had his
share.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Red hitched closer to David’s side.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The other day,” he half whispered, “I was
flat on me back under a tarpaulin in the far
corner of the baggage room up in the hull, installing
some wiring that’s to lead down from
the observer’s seat on the top of the ship.
The other fella had to go clear over to the
storehouse for some wire. So I laid there
tryin’ to think out a simpler and safer installation.
I don’t like it the way it is, Dave.
Too much danger during storms. Well, whilst
I’m there, along comes Colonel Porter and
himself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Who is himself?” asked David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That big bug; the papa of us all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You don’t mean Mr. Hammond?” said
David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You got it. That’s the bird!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But what the devil is he doing here now?
I thought he was in New York.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m the boy to tell you,” said Red, joyfully.
“My brother, the chaplain, used to tell me,
‘Red, never eavesdrop; ’tis a mean and unmanly
trick, unworthy of a good Christian
b’y; but so be you do chance to hear anything,
give it strict attention, and be sure to get the
straight of it.’ So I did. They come teeterin’
along the catwalk, and stop opposite me. You
know the Big Fella’s quick and light steppin’
as a cat, for all his size. Ladders and catwalks
are pie for him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘What’s bein’ done here?’ says the Big
Fella.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Some wirin’,’ I heard Colonel Porter answer.
Then there was some little talk or
other that I don’t just remember.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Red wouldn’t tell what they had said at
that point, but it glowed warmly in his honest
heart; payment in full for many hours of
grilling toil. Colonel Porter had explained the
wiring, and had added,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“We have the cleverest young mechanic in
the school that I have ever come across. I believe
he could make every part and assemble
any known engine, after an hour’s study.
Name’s Ryan.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond had grunted.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hang on to him. He may be useful a little
later on.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, then what?” asked David, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh!” said Red. “Well then, ‘What sorta
mechanics you got?’ asks the Big Fella.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘So-so,’ says the Colonel.</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Only so-so?’ growls Big Stuff. ‘Better
bounce ’em; the quicker the better.’</p>

<p class='c006'>“‘Well, I dunno,’ says the Colonel, lookin’
wise the way he does. ‘I dunno. There’s one
lad, now; our efficiency expert spent three
days checkin’ up on that b’y, and he figured it
out that the fella had saved the company one
and seven-eighths cents in a week, on insulated wire!
In wan week, mind you; Ryan’s
the name.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You big liar!” exploded David, grinning.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Me?” Red’s sea blue eyes were wide and
innocent.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, you! When you lie, you always lie in
a brogue. I can always tell.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wonder, now, if that’s a slam on my ancestry,”
said Red slowly. “If it is, I got to
fight the upstart who says it. Only, can a
mechanic, first-class, stoop to the killin’ of a
mere apprentice? If you’d only shut up,
David; if you could only learn to be still, I’d
tell you what I been strugglin’ to tell this hour
back.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, go on; go on, for heaven’s sake! Spill
it if you know anything. I need something to
pep me up. I’m going stale.” David sighed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Red laid a hand on David’s arm and grew
grave.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s about your baby up there, the ship.
The Big Fella is plannin’ no less than a round-the-world
trip, for her maiden stunt.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Round the world!” breathed David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That, and nothin’ less!” affirmed Red.
“Yep, by diligent listening I got it all. I’m
afraid they thought they were alone. So they
talked free. It seems that Mr. Hammond
wants an American ship that will beat the
Graf Zeppelin’s time. And he thinks here’s
the ship. So do I. Well, Mr. Hammond is
financing the trip, with a couple of others who
will go along as passengers, just for the
glory.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Lord! Red, I wish I could go with her!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t you, just? But there’s not a chance.
You couldn’t get in on that trip if you was
disguised as a tin of biscuit. There will be
millionaires that would get into overalls and
carry oil cans to get to go.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course,” said David. “But I can’t help
wishing. Wouldn’t you like it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Me? Boy, I’d hang on to a rudder blade
with me right hand from here to Japan, and
then merely shift to the left. Like to go?
Lord love me, David, wouldn’t I just!”</p>

<p class='c006'>David sat staring at the silver ship. Men
scrambled about her, popping in and out of
the openings.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Listen, Davie,” said Red. “Don’t let your
right ear know what I’ve poured into your
left. My brother used to tell me, ‘Whatever
you hear, me young buckaroo, keep it under
your hat.’ But he wouldn’t have counted you,
David. ‘Keep it to yourself,’ says he. ‘If it
is trash, don’t clutter the highways wid it. If
it is something worth while, lock it up, Red;
lock it up, like you would a dimant, till the
fella that owns it wants to use it.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I won’t say anything,” promised David.
“You certainly like that Padre of yours, don’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So-so,” said Red, chuckling. “He’s grand
if you’re dyin’ I’ve been told, but he’s sure a
murderin’ cuss, so be you don’t walk straight
whilst you’re enjoyin’ your usual health.
Come on, let’s go down town and have a sody.”</p>

<p class='c006'>David was not listening. He pulled a worn
notebook from his pocket and commenced to
study its grimy pages.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come on, fella!” repeated Red. “Leap
into the Rolls-Worse. I’m starvin’ for a sody.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m glad they used that new kind of covering,
with those tricky interwoven seams,” said
David dreamily, ignoring the appeal of the
starving one. “They are going to save lots of
worry, Red, and it’s certain they won’t give.
That old blimp we tried it on with rips here
and there to give the wind a chance, you remember?
The seams never budged. The new
alloy duralumin I like too, and the longer,
slimmer line of the hull.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Red sat down again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Those engines! Dave, they are as perfect—Lord,
I love ’em! All the time they have
been in there on the blocks, stopping and
starting, stopping and starting; well, they
have talked to me, David. One day a girl
came in, a sightseer; and she yelled, ‘My,
what a horrid noise! Isn’t it just awful?’ and
I thought how nice it would be to tap her with
a wrench, but I didn’t. I let that engine answer.
I tuned her up and you couldn’t hear
yourself think. Oh, but they are pretty, those
engines! I don’t know whether I love ’em most
when they are quiet and dreamin’ of what
they can do, or when they are goin’ full speed
with every part doin’ its bit, so smooth and so
true that there’s no words to describe it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are a sentimental Irishman,” said
David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m an Irishman that wants a sody,” said
Red.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They will be putting the last engine in
place this afternoon, won’t they?” asked
David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, and I’ve got to be here. Then she will
be practically finished. Just woodwork to
wipe, and furniture to dust, and beds to make.
Sounds like a housewarming.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did you know that they have named her?”
asked David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No. I thought she was the Silver Ship.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course, but she has to have a sort of
given name, like the Shenandoah, poor girl,
and the Dawn, and the Sun God, and the rest.
I heard Mr. Hammond’s daughter named her.
She’s the Moonbeam.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s all right,” said Red approvingly.
“I give the girl credit. The Moonbeam!
Faith, it grows on me, Davie. Moonbeam!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I like it,” said David. “Pretty, and easy to
say, but not silly.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, here’s wishin’ her all the luck in the
world,” said Red. “And the same to us. They
just got to let me go when she takes her first
try-out. I’d no sooner let those engines out
of my sight first off than I’d use an umbrella
for a ’chute.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Better not let the engine crews hear you,
you conceited devil! They think they’re
pretty kippy themselves.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good lads, all,” admitted Red. “What they
don’t know about engines scarcely needs to be
known, but it don’t matter what you do,
David, you have got to put something beside
knowledge in your work. It’s like those old
fellas who used to put human blood in their
cauldrons of metal when they made their
church bells. They thought it made the bells
sound sweeter. And so it did, so long as they
thought so. You can’t say your engine is a
fine old piece of bits and parts. You’ve got
to love it. You remember last summer, when
we flew east? I ran over to Providence to see
my brother. Well, one night I wandered into
the engine room at Brown &amp; Sharpe’s, and the
chief engineer showed me his engines. Gosh!
there were tunnels full of them. And he went
along with an oil can and a bit of waste, rubbin’
a bit here and a bit there, where God
knows it didn’t need it, pretending to oil; just
loving them.” He jumped up. “Honest, Dave,
you’ve no heart! Come on! I’ve just got to
have that sody—or perhaps I didn’t mention
it before?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He took a step around the aged car, and
stood staring.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come here!” he said. “See Mr. Hammond
over there? Do you see who is with him? Or
is he, maybe, all alone?”</p>

<p class='c006'>David looked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t know the chap with him,” he decided.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Look again,” begged Red. “Don’t you
know that strut, and those skinny legs, and
that face? Think, man, think!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never saw him,” declared David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never? Well, listen here; may the Saints
lead him off this lot, immediate! If they don’t,
there’s cloud banks and rain and hail ahead
for you and me. That’s Cram!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So it is!” said David. “Well, what of it?
He has no grudge against us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hasn’t he, then? Didn’t you pass your
exams, three years ago, and didn’t he fail?
Watch out, me lad! He hasn’t changed his
spots in three years. I know him, and all his
breed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t be so suspicious,” said David, watching
the trim, thin figure slowly approaching.
“Honestly, Red, why do you let that man get
your goat? You never act like that with anybody
else, no matter what they do.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Red shrugged. “Dunno!” he said. “My
brother holds that every man has his own particular
devil to torture and tantalize him. I
feel shame, Davie, but Walter Cram seems to
be my own little devil. I have got to have two
sodies, now. I’m that upset.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Cram, for it was he, glanced idly at the
passing roadster but did not recognize the
occupants. The years had made little outward
change in his appearance. He was
taller, still thin, and moved with nervous alertness.
He wore glasses, and they disguised the
shadows under his eyes; violet shadows, that
hinted of escapades that he would not care to
publish. For Wally Cram, the man, was still
as devious as Wally, the boy. Strangely
enough, the one fever that burned in his
blood, his one dream, his sole ambition, was
based on an overwhelming vanity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Without the ability to achieve the eminence
he aspired to, he longed for a foremost place
in the public eye. In his thoughts all heroes
wore his own features. Lindbergh, winging
his lonely way to France; Byrd, exploring a
frozen world; Andrews, forcing the Gobi desert
to speak an articulate language of past
æons—Cram wanted what they had, but he
had grown into a lazy man, incapable of sustained
effort.</p>

<p class='c006'>Reading a newspaper in his New York hotel
one day, Wally had seen an article that had
given him a grand idea—a magnificent idea.
At once he called his lawyers in Oklahoma
City on long distance, and held a conversation
with them filled with so many millions that
even the telephone operator was impressed.</p>

<p class='c006'>A week later he was in Ayre, and walking
through the lobby of the hotel he heard a
familiar voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, Mister Cram!” it said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dulcie Hammond, by all that’s good!”
ejaculated Cram. “What are you doing
here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Looking after daddy, as usual,” Dulcie
Hammond laughed. “He’s here in pursuit of
his hobby. Perhaps I should call it a life work.
You know the new dirigible starts on her
maiden trip around the world in two weeks,
and naturally dad is going. He says I can’t
go; isn’t that wet? In the meantime I am seeing
that he takes his bicarb after meals, and
making him lay off hot dogs, and pop corn
and pie. Heavens, he’s an unruly child! Between
times I mostly hang around the plant
and watch them put the finishing touches to
the ship. Did you know that I named her?
She’s the Moonbeam.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fine! Why don’t you go along?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s to be a sort of stag party,” said Dulcie
petulantly. “I can’t make dad understand
that I wouldn’t be a bother. I’ll bet Lady
Drummond Hay wasn’t a bother. I met her
in New York, and she told me their trip was
just too galumptious. And I am just as good
a sport as she is, and probably tougher, because
I’m younger.” She pondered. “Well,
we’ll see! But what are you doing here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just looking after some investments. I
have stock in the Goodlow Plant, and I have
just invested a lot of money in the Moonbeam;
enough, I hope, to get me a berth on her
round-the-world cruise. I am going out to the
drome now. Won’t you come?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Got to do some shopping,” said Dulcie.
“Sorry. Oh, Wally, the ship is too beautiful
for words, even now, while she is still unfinished.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Cram laughed. “Rot! The dirigible is
nothing but a balloon.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Dulcie gave him a scornful glance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have a sordid soul,” she said, and
walked away.</p>

<p class='c006'>That night David and Red had orders to report
at sunrise for a short trip in the Dawn,
a smaller dirigible which had been in commission
for a couple of months. They went
up with the usual crew, and Mr. Hammond
and Captain Fraine and half a dozen others as
passengers. David, to his surprise, was put in
full charge of the ship, Captain Fraine preferring
to wander around, inspecting. They
were out for twenty-four hours, without stops,
and David returned the ship to Ayre, making
a perfect landing at the hangar.</p>

<p class='c006'>Red took him aside.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Something’s in the wind, fella. You didn’t
get to handle that ship just because they loved
you. And there’s older chief mechanics than
me who might have gone. Watch out!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Two days later the Moonbeam was completed.
The last workmen crawled out of the
hull, while decorators reverently closed the
door of the great passenger gondola. Every
bag, cord, wire, seam, every bolt and screw
had been tested and retested. She hung aloft
in the vast hangar, a beautiful and majestic
thing, ready for the infinite. David gazed and
gazed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Before I managed to ditch school,” said
Red unexpectedly at his side, “they read us
about a place called Mount Olympus. Grand
big women lived there. Goddesses. Not real,
you know, but I got an awful kick out of ’em.
And the Moonbeam; ain’t she a goddess?
Those old goddesses used to pick up a mortal
like they were nothin’ and carry them off.
And here’s a silver ship, just waiting to gather
up a load of folks, like an armful of babies,
and go soarin’ out and up and away into—Oh,
my gosh! the thought makes me want to
yell. I want to jump on my hat, or fight somebody.”</p>

<p class='c006'>David smiled. “I know. Pipe down, old
son. Come on to quarters. I’m dog tired, and
the silver ship will wait.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The following morning the ship took her
maiden walk out of the hangar, and was
moored to the mast. Seeing her there, automobiles
began to gather, street-car lines disgorged
curious sightseers, and for hours a big
crowd milled under the glistening shape.
Toward evening the ship was drawn down
and returned to the hangar.</p>

<p class='c006'>At supper an official-looking envelope was
brought to David. He read its contents unbelieving,
then again perused the terse sentences.</p>

<p class='c012'>David forgot his supper, forgot everything.
It could scarcely be real! While he struggled
with his surprise and delight, hardly believing
the good fortune that he had not even dared
to hope for, he heard Red’s voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Read it! Read it, fella!” he cried, and he
pressed into David’s hand a letter similar to
his own, appointing Red as chief mechanic on
the round-the-world flight of the Moonbeam.
For once Red had nothing to say. The moment
was too great, the news too stupendous.</p>

<p class='c006'>David pushed back his chair; he could not
eat. They went out and, crossing the great
landing field to the hangar, they sat down on a
truck and looked at the closed doors.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She’s in there, Dave, safe and sound! And
in two weeks she will carry us away over land
and sea, rough mountains and sweet valleys—round
the world, and home again. You and
me, David; assistant pilot and mechanic!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Chief mechanic, as I read it,” said David,
smiling. “Well, I must wire my mother the
good news.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s right, and I must telegraph my
mother, too, and that blackguard brother of
mine, as well. I’ll just say to him, ‘Your Reverence,
the ugly duckling has become a swan.
Am startin’ on a world cruise in the Moonbeam
on the fifteenth of June. What’s to be
done about it?’ That will stop him all right.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can’t think of a greater thing to have
happen to us,” mused David. “Around the
world, Red! Get it? Seeing all those countries,
and meeting so many people. The first
American dirigible to fly around the world!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” said Red, “and having those blessed
engines right where I can keep an eye on them,
day and night. Going full blast, and me with
an ear for every beat. I’m just crazy with joy,
Dave. Let’s go and get a sody.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They climbed into their jointly owned and
jointly loved roadster, and started it toward
the nearest soda fountain, its fenders flapping,
its body squeaking and rattling as
though in proud defiance of its softly purring
motor—Red’s “favorite child.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We have come a good way in the past four
years, Red,” David bellowed over the din.
“Sometimes the work has seemed pretty stiff,
but I’d work twice as hard, if possible, for
what I have gained.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yeah!” said Red, nodding his bright head.
“And sometimes I feel that it just isn’t so.
All this. I’ll wake up, and find myself a kid;
in bed listenin’ to a worn awning rope rattlin’,
and a freight train grumblin’ on the sidin’
across the street. You know, Dave, even
when I was a kid there was something in me
pushing up, and reaching out, for something
I couldn’t reach or see.” His voice grew bitter.
“I knew a fella once who smoked and
caroused too much, and one day he went down
and out. He’d never taken anybody’s advice
about taking care of himself. Well, after his
heart cracked on him, the poor devil just went
around beggin’ the rest of his gang to lay off,
and go to bed once in a while. However, one
day his poor old engine stopped, and that was
the end of him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was like that about school. Everybody
tellin’ me I ought to finish high school, and
me knowin’ better than the whole of ’em. I
tell you, Dave, I’d give anything for the
chance, now. Now I see what I’ve thrown
away. And I need it; Lord, how I need it!
It means that I’ve got to make it up, sweating
and groaning. Night schools, and correspondence
schools, and study. Because, so help me,
Dave, I won’t disgrace my engines.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And it’s a fact, Davie, I actually go around
stoppin’ kids on the street, and preachin’
school to ’em. I say, ‘Smoke if you like, and
drink if you want to be a fool; but lay off
long enough to get yourself through high
school.’ And I’m like the poor fella in
Lawton. I’ve a dark suspicion that I’m wastin’
words.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch05' class='c007'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />A STOWAWAY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Day whirled after day, filled with pleasant
labor. Each morning the Moonbeam was sent
up for a flight which sometimes occupied but
a few hours, and sometimes stretched into the
night. At first there were many little things
to do for her; adjustments, changes, the
tightening of a screw here, the tuning up of a
brace there. Men watched the propeller
shafts, and listened to the smooth roar of the
engines in their throbbing “eggs.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Captain Fraine, with his navigators at his
side, tried for altitude and depth; nosed up,
swept down, turned the ship in majestic circles.
She responded perfectly. Her bulk, so
much greater than that of any previous dirigible,
seemed to have no effect in the action
of her great engines, and she answered the
wheel with absolute ease.</p>

<p class='c006'>At mess one night Red strolled over to
David’s table with a letter. “From Padre
Ryan,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>David took the sheet. It was brief.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dear Swan:</p>

<p class='c010'>Your night letter enchants me. I rejoice
that you’ve such a big chance before you. And
if you don’t uphold the honor of the family I’ll
lay the curse of Saint Morvin on you. He’s little
known, but most efficacious.</p>

<p class='c010'>I’ll pray for you. As a child you had a bad
way of leaning out of upstairs windows. Have
the ship screened.</p>

<div class='nf-right-c0'>
<div class='nf-right c009'  >
    Your devoted and loving brother,<br />
    John.
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>David laughed. “He must be a card, all
right.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, he’s not so bad,” said Red. “A kindly
priest, and a good son to his mother. David,
I’m all set for the take-off.”</p>

<p class='c006'>So was David. On the morning of the fifteenth,
he was the first man at the hangar,
and it was his hand that pressed the lever,
putting in motion the mechanism that slid
back the great doors.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was not yet dawn, but a vast mob packed
the field. For months the building of the
great dirigible had been followed, detail by
detail, by an interested public. Her plans,
charts and dimensions had appeared in all the
leading newspapers and magazines, accompanied
by long articles.</p>

<p class='c006'>Finally came the news of her completion.
The announcement of the round-the-world
flight as her maiden effort was the spark
which caused the enthusiasm of the public to
burst into flame. A year ago they had watched
the detailed accounts of the Graf Zeppelin,
as radiograms marked her flight.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now a ship of their own; an American ship
financed with American money and manned,
from the commander down, with Americans,
was to essay the same journey, hoping to better
the time of the Graf Zeppelin. The papers
devoted pages to the anticipated adventure.
Radiograms, cables, letters of congratulation
and good wishes, invitations from half the
countries of Europe asking Mr. Hammond to
detour in their several directions and stop off,
were printed for the pleasure of a public
which felt a proprietary interest in the Moonbeam.</p>

<p class='c006'>All night the field had been black with
people. With fine democracy they slept in
their trucks, their flivvers, or their Packards,
and at intervals ate hot dogs and sandwiches.
Hundreds of soldiers labored to keep the field
about the hangar clear for the departure of
the outgoing ship. And still they came. The
first trolleys were packed with frantic hordes
that pushed and jostled to get near the ropes
that had been stretched along for hundreds of
yards, and through which people continually
broke.</p>

<p class='c006'>At last, as the crews walked the great
gleaming shape out onto the field, a deafening
cheer broke like a portentous wave. Hoarse
voices cried, “Good luck, Moonbeam! Good
luck!—’ray! ’ray! ’ray!—Go in and win,
Moonbeam! Beat the Zep! Beat the Zep!”</p>

<p class='c006'>When Mr. Hammond’s car drove up, Dulcie
hopped gaily out, her little Pekinese hugged
under her arm.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Isn’t this jam perfectly terrific?” she said
to Captain Fraine. “We could scarcely get
through.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Most of them have been here all night,”
said Captain Fraine. “They’re certainly enthusiastic.
These troops the Governor sent
down have had a lively time keeping them off
the field.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Any of the passengers here yet?” asked
Dulcie.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Most of them, although it’s early yet. They
seem afraid the boat will start without them!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m going on board,” said Dulcie. “I want
to put dad’s bicarbonate where he will see it.
He always loses it, poor dear, whenever he
gets indigestion.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Plenty of time, Miss Hammond,” said
Fraine, as he escorted her to the steps leading
up to the passenger gondola. “I wish you
were going with us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So do I!” sighed Dulcie.</p>

<p class='c006'>She went into her father’s cabin, and arranged
several small bottles and boxes on a
shelf. Her father came in.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wish I dared take you with me, honey,”
he said wistfully. “But I can’t risk you, can
I? If anything should happen—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s just as you say, daddy. I’ve teased all
I have the face to. But please don’t wave at
me when you start. I might bust right out
and cry. So I’ll run right off and get lost in
the crowd.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You behave yourself while I’m gone, Dulcie,
and no running around with that young
bounder of a Greene chap back home.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I won’t speak to him while you are away,”
Dulcie promised. “And I will behave all the
time exactly as though you had your eye on
me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She kissed him lightly, and was gone, leaving
him with a feeling of loneliness and loss
that overshadowed the pleasure of the take-off.</p>

<p class='c006'>The engines were adding a deep roar to the
human sounds. People strained against those
in front, and pushed them into the ropes.
Small dogs dodged into the open space and
barked. The crew swarmed up and took their
places in the ship, with excitement written
large all over them. Two of the reporters
paused for last-minute shots. Movie cameramen,
thanking their stars for the bright sun
that had appeared, ground frantically. Automobiles
began to toot their horns as at length,
the last man on board, the ground crew of five
hundred men walked toward the ship from
the spread-fan positions they had been holding.
The twenty thousand spectators let out
a mighty roar; a sea of upturned faces
watched as the Moonbeam rose slowly, her
motors drowning the noise of the crowd.</p>

<p class='c006'>From a window Mr. Hammond searched
through his glasses for a familiar little figure.
“I thought the kid would wave me off, after
all,” he said to himself. “Wish now I had
brought her along. At least I would know
where she was.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Couldn’t have had a better take-off, commander,”
said Captain Fraine, at his side.
“Her engines simply sing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Glad you are pleased, captain,” answered
Mr. Hammond. “We’ll soon see how she performs.
We are out to make a record, as you
know, and that means a steady, day-after-day
excellence. From Lakehurst to Friedrichshafen
is approximately forty-two hundred
miles. We have got to make up some of our
time on that leg of the trip. I don’t know
Russia at all; in fact, I am a little dubious
about it, although Dr. Eckener experienced
no trouble whatever.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why didn’t you bring your daughter along,
commander?” asked Captain Fraine. “The
Graf Zeppelin had a woman passenger.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know, I know! I suppose I am just fussy
over the kid. I wanted her where I knew she
would be safe. She’s going to the seashore.
Hope she won’t swim out too far.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Does she drive her own car?” asked
Fraine, hiding a grin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Lord, yes, drives like the very devil.” He
turned his back, and looked down. The crowds
were far away. “Buck up, buck up, you old
fool!” he told himself savagely. “She’s all
right—but I’ll bring her along next time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The sunlight was glorious; glittering and
flashing, the ship circled above Ayre, returned
to her own field, and dipped low in a graceful
gesture of farewell, while the waiting crowds
went mad. Rising, she sped eastward toward
Lakehurst, her first stop. Under her flowed
the lovely panorama of Ohio; gently rolling
woodland, wide and opulent farms with dark
patches of plowed lands and the lush green of
springing crops. Towns appeared here and
there, little huddles of houses at crossroads,
and large cities, where the smoke of manufactories
spiraled lazily upwards, as though
pointing indolently at the passing ship.</p>

<p class='c006'>David went into the chart room, and found
Red poring over the passenger list.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I see we’ve got a medico with us,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, Dr. Forsythe; of course the Company
would send their own doctor.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here’s a big guy in his line,” said David.
“Sanford Hamilton, of New York, and a dozen
other places. Has so much money he can’t
count it, but just can’t stop making more.
Has the habit.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wish I could get a habit like that. Well,
the Ryans own the two most worthless farms
on God’s green earth, and I never can get over
expectin’ to see a fine squirt of oil come
leapin’ out of them, although the experts say
they are as dry as dust. Who’s next on the
list?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dr. Martin Trigg, and Dr. Nicholas Sims.
They are the two old professors from Princeton.
Scientists of some sort—big bugs.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I helped ’em aboard,” said Red, chuckling.
“One of ’em said ‘Thank you, my boy, thank
you,’ just as pretty, but the other looked at me
till I felt like a bug on a pin.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The next four I haven’t seen,” said David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Skip ’em,” counseled Red. “Reporters.
Wild-eyed, sort of. You can always tell ’em.
Always huntin’ a scoop for the next edition,
regardless of time or place.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“These two are men Commander Hammond
is trying to interest in dirigibles.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Uh huh,” said Red. “Be polite.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Emil Hausen—he’s a German. We leave
him at Friedrichshafen.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I must practice my German on him,” said
Red. “I know four fine upstandin’ words:
<em>Ach du lieber Augustin</em>. Would you think
they’d sound homelike to the poor wanderer,
Davie?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Try ’em!” laughed Davie; “I’ll pick up the
pieces.” He wandered off, stopping to admire
the salon. In one corner, at a small but
perfectly appointed desk, Mr. Hamilton already
sat dictating rapidly to his secretary.
The great king of Wall Street was preparing
to radio his orders, keeping a tight rein on his
active money.</p>

<p class='c006'>At a window the two old scientists, Doctors
Trigg and Sims, quarreled in low, tense tones
over something referred to in such lengthily
technical terms that David did not know
whether they had disagreed about dinosaurs,
angleworms, or air currents. As David
passed, the smaller of the two men looked up
and nodded.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, son,” he chirruped in a pleasant
crisp voice, “making fair progress, I should
say. This your first trip? Great experience;
illuminating, developing. Make the most of
it—you are young. Perhaps you will like it so
well that before we have entirely circumnavigated
the globe, you will have sprouted mental
wings and will accept the ether for your habitat.
I hope so—I hope so! Aerial navigation
needs young blood, young enthusiasms.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bosh!” retorted the second sage, Doctor
Sims himself. “Bosh! There is no young enthusiasm;
it’s grown old, money loving, comfort
seeking; its bones creak. Don’t I know?
Don’t I teach about a hundred and fifty
youngsters every day of the week? Bah!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sims, you are as dry as a dinosaur egg,”
Doctor Trigg exploded. “As an instructor in
grades equaling yours, I am also in a position
to collect data and observe reactions. The
world is moved by youthful enthusiasms. It
is, thank God, an inexhaustible force, propelling
the world; a force, Sims, which our instruments
cannot gauge, which all your retorts
and chemical tests cannot resolve into its
component parts. And let me tell you, Sims,
in the modern aviator there lives the spirit of
the adventurers of all time; a gallant, intrepid
and invincible army that comes marching
down the gray ages to be reincarnated as
the greatest of all the cavaliers of chance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“For centuries they have been crusaders;
they have sailed uncharted seas; they have
braved killing heat and searing cold. They
have fought the dragons of every age and
clime, wrestling with the earth for jewels and
gold, building glittering cities in desert places,
throwing fairy bridges from crag to crag.
Now, spurning the reclaimed earth, they have
taken their indomitable courage and their
boundless enthusiasm, Sims, into the limitless
sea of the air, whose currents and eddies and
tempests are more treacherous and terrible
than ever beset any ocean.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He had been tapping his words out on Doctor
Sims’ bony knee. Suddenly realizing an
acute discomfort there, Doctor Sims removed
the knee abruptly, and looked up at David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now you,” he remarked, ignoring his
brother educator’s dissertation. “You’re
planning to be a big newspaper man, aren’t
you? Eh?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, no, sir,” said David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Automobile tires, then—automobile tires,”
Doctor Sims cut in.</p>

<p class='c006'>He seemed about to launch on a tirade
against tires, and David spoke quickly. “I am
an aviator,” he said, “and I want to thank
Doctor Trigg for what he just said. It is all
true;” and looking at the doctor with a light
bow, he added, “and it is pretty fine for us
youngsters to feel that men like you understand
us, and are with us.” He smiled the
smile that always won friends for him, and
passed on into the little hallway.</p>

<p class='c006'>Behind him he could hear Doctor Trigg
burst into a loud cackle. He knew, without
looking, that Professor Sims was dodging a
skinny finger.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What a peachy old card!” thought David.
“And can’t he just pour out the language?
He’s just right, too.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In the hall outside the washroom he found
Red. He seemed preoccupied.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hello,” he said. “Say, Dave, listen; do you
hear a funny noise?”</p>

<p class='c006'>David listened. “Why, yes. Sounds sort of
squeakish. We are not near an egg, and
there’s nothing over us but the crew’s quarters,
is there?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing over or under; but it’s a darned
queer noise. You can’t hear it five feet away.”
To prove it, he slid along with his ear pressed
against the partition. “It’s here, somewhere,
right here by Mr. Hammond’s cabin.” He
went down on his knees. “Comes from low
down. Now I can’t hear it at all. Damn
queer!”</p>

<p class='c006'>David also knelt, and they listened in silence,
staring at each other. The sound was
intermittent; a whiffling, wheezing squeak,
and occasionally a faint tearing sound.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fabric going,” said David anxiously. “It’s
not a bag, because the disturbance is low down
by the floor.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, we got to find out about that,” declared Red.
“It may be just a piece of cloth
rattling at a window, or something, but there
mustn’t be any unusual noises on a boat like
this, where everything means something. I’d
hate to have to turn back now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They stood up as Mr. Hammond entered the
passageway. David explained their trouble.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Under or over my room, eh?” he said, unlatching
his door.</p>

<p class='c006'>A small brown streak shot into the hall,
recognized the paternal trousers, whirled and
fell at Mr. Hammond’s feet in an ecstasy of
delight.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What the devil—why, you damned little
runt, how do you happen to be here? It’s
Dulcie’s pup, Koko.” He picked up the little
fellow and petted him. “Dulcie must have
shut him in my room while she was on board,
and then the poor kid was so upset when she
left that she must have forgotten the little
beggar. Well, Koko, we can’t drop you offside,
can we? We will just send a ’gram to
your missie, and take you with us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There’s our funny noise, Red,” laughed
David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gee, you had me scared, you little scoundrel!”
remarked Red, with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He hates to be shut up; I’ll bet he was
chewing something up,” Mr. Hammond
chuckled. “Well, I’m glad he’s here. I wish
I’d brought Dulcie, too. She’d be just about
as safe up here as she will be swimming and
canoeing and dancing, and racing all over
creation in that damned car of hers.” He
looked at the boys, and saw that their eyes,
staring over his shoulder into the little cabin
beyond, were filled with amazement, amusement,
and concern.</p>

<p class='c006'>Red broke unexpectedly into a hearty
laugh. “Well, Mr. Hammond—excuse us, sir!
Beat it, Dave!”</p>

<p class='c006'>They bolted into the salon, and Mr. Hammond
turned to his room. What he saw there
made his old heart leap. He dropped the dog.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dulcie!” he cried, and Dulcie ran into his
open arms.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are a bad, bad girl!” he whispered
presently. “You are a stowaway; and you
have made a fool of your poor old father.
Who put you up to this?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No one, daddy,” said Dulcie, rubbing her
eyes which were full of tears and her nose
which bore a nice imprint of rough tweed. “I
knew you really wanted me, and you know
my judgment is much better than yours in
such things, so I just stayed quietly in here.
I knew you would come in later, but Koko
nearly spoiled it all. And you really do want
me? I heard what you said. It’s a lesson to
you, too; your child is going along wherever
you go, and it only makes unnecessary scenes
when you try to stop her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond blew his nose loudly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, darling, I am glad you are here. Yes,
I’m delighted; but don’t get it into your head
that you have established a precedent. No,
ma’am!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“All right, precious. Now comb your hair;
it looks all rat-taily. And take your bicarb;
it is long past time for breakfast. I’m starved.
That small suitcase is mine. I took your
things out of it and put them all in your other
one. You are a rotten packer, daddy. Please
move the man in the next stateroom out when
you get round to it. I’ll take it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you mean,” said Mr. Hammond, grimly
wagging a finger at the suitcase, “that you
had this all cooked up yesterday?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, for weeks, daddy darling. Did you
honestly think I would consider letting you
come alone? I’m surprised. I’m starved, too.
What an appetite this nice high air gives one!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come on to breakfast then,” Mr. Hammond
groaned. “Let’s get it over with!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t see any reason for you to be embarrassed,
if I am not,” said Dulcie, doing a
little careful work with a lipstick. “It was
frightfully embarrassing for me to be left at
home like a little girl.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Too bad!” growled Mr. Hammond, a
twinkle in his eye that belied the tone. “Too
bad! Well, gimme that infernal soda, and
let’s go.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What’s in there?” said Dulcie, pointing to
a large box on a chair. “Koko seems to think
it’s something to eat. He nearly tore the
paper.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He’s a smart little beggar,” said Mr. Hammond,
in an offhand manner. “Oh, yes, that’s
yours, that box. Candy—thought you might
like to have it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Daddy!” cried Dulcie, casting herself at
him. “Daddy, you precious adorable old lamb-pie!
You knew I would come!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I confess I did have hopes you would
pull it off,” said the adorable lamb-pie sheepishly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch06' class='c007'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br />THE CONTROL ROOM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Mr. Hammond had no occasion to worry
over Dulcie’s welcome. After a hearty laugh
all round at her father’s expense, she became,
as Doctor Trigg said, “the child of the regiment.”
Her sunny presence raised the morale
of the whole ship. Only Red groaned.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’ve got to keep topside-upside now,
whatever happens,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>Doctor Trigg took her under his special
care, muttering to Doctor Sims, “More youthful
enthusiasm, my boy; more youthful enthusiasm!
She wants to fly, too, you see.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“G-r-r-r-r bah!” replied Doctor Sims briefly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Those of the passengers who were flying for
the first time watched the distant earth with
fascinated and slightly worried eyes. They
seemed disinclined to leave the windows, and
ate their excellent luncheon without interest.
By the time afternoon tea was served, however,
they apparently decided that the globe
would not disappear if they failed to keep a
restraining gaze upon it, and talked gaily over
the hot toast and marmalade.</p>

<p class='c006'>Radiograms had been sent ahead to Lakehurst,
and answers received. They were
eagerly expected, but Mr. Hammond decided
that their stop there should be a very brief one.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lakehurst, they found, when the ship slid
into view above the field, was at least ready
with a noisy welcome. Whistles, horns and
sirens tooted, screeched and moaned. The
landing crew ran out to secure the ropes, as
Captain Fraine eased her gracefully down.
The steps were adjusted, and the door of the
passenger gondola was opened. The passengers,
warned that they must be on board again
at eleven o’clock, stepped down, not sorry to
find terra firma actually under their feet
again. A group of officials and leading citizens
welcomed Mr. Hammond and his officers,
and the ship was rapidly propelled into the
big hangar, where the local force of mechanics
and engineers assisted the Moonbeam’s own
crew in a microscopic examination of every
part. An extra amount of fuel and gas was
taken on, being stored in the place of ballast.
An extra quantity of dry ice was shipped, and
all commissary stores checked up.</p>

<p class='c006'>Time passed rapidly, and the passengers
commenced to return, hurrying in taxis and
on foot. Mr. Hamilton’s secretary rushed
ahead with a bundle of telegrams; Doctors
Trigg and Sims came with their arms full of
papers and magazines; a car whirled up, and
the driver hurriedly approached Dulcie just
as she was about to mount into the gondola
and handed her a great box from the officers
of the field. Long rose stems stuck intriguingly
out at one end.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What has happened to Captain Fraine?”
inquired David of Mr. Hammond as they stood
near the steps.</p>

<p class='c006'>Looking very white, Captain Fraine approached.
A couple of young officers accompanied
him. He held a bloodstained handkerchief
to his head but managed to laugh as he
saw them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not so bad as it looks, commander,” he
said lightly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What happened?” demanded Mr. Hammond.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They are doing some construction work
back in the hangar,” one of the strangers explained,
“and something had loosened the supports
of a platform where some boards were
lying. A two-by-four slipped off, and came
down and hit the captain here, right on the
head. It might have been pretty serious. It’s
too bad.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It will be all right as soon as Dr. Forsythe
puts a bit of plaster on it. Don’t think of it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’ll get on board, and see the doctor at
once,” advised Mr. Hammond. “Go with him,
David.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Forsythe proceeded to examine the
bump. It was a bad one, but the skin was
only slightly broken. He stopped the bleeding,
and plastered it up. Captain Fraine declared
that he felt as good as new, and went
directly into the control room, while David
returned to Mr. Hammond.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Weren’t we to pick up Walter Cram here
at Lakehurst?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We were,” Mr. Hammond replied. “He
has just five more minutes to get here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, looks like he’d made it, at that,” said
David, as a taxi raced up, stopped at the gate
with a jolt, and an agitated figure leaped out
and hurried across the field, a suitcase in each
hand. A minute later, Cram stood smiling
beside them, breathless but still self-assured.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hope I didn’t keep you waiting long, commander,”
he said ingratiatingly.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the stroke of twelve, with Lakehurst
making all the noise it could, the Moonbeam
took off, and soon after the passengers retired,
leaving only the officers in charge to
watch while she started over the high sea.</p>

<p class='c006'>Wednesday morning found everyone refreshed
and enthusiastic. Dulcie’s Lakehurst
roses gave the salon a gala appearance. Below
them the Atlantic lay as smooth as a floor,
the bright sun glistening on its surface.</p>

<p class='c006'>They had been flying very low. Two liners
passed beneath them, and saluted with puffs
of fleecy smoke. In return the ship majestically
inclined her silver nose in a triple dip.</p>

<p class='c006'>Later they gained altitude smoothly, and
reached fifteen hundred feet. Now little fleecy
clouds met them and broke like foam on the
prow. The air was clear, the sun blinding.
The passengers accepted the new environment
with ease. They read, slept, or wrote letters
filled with detailed descriptions.</p>

<p class='c006'>David found it hard to absent himself from
the control room for more than a few minutes
at a time, although with Captain Fraine in
command and Lieutenant Florsheim as second
pilot, David had actually no more to do than
an observer, except for his turn at the wheel.
Mr. Hammond came in often, too. On one of
his visits his eyes were attracted to Captain
Fraine as the young man pressed his palm to
the top of his bandaged temple.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is that troubling you, Fraine?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s really all right,” replied Captain
Fraine. “Just sore, and tender. The plank
hit me squarely on my old wound. The place
has always been a little troublesome. Worse
in stormy weather, I notice. There’s a silver
plate in there, and I think it doesn’t fit very
well. I mean to have it looked after, sometime.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Better not neglect it,” advised Mr. Hammond.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It really has never troubled me enough to
speak of, but that board would have given a
good crack to a harder head than mine.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, don’t try to stand all the watches.
Make these youngsters take that wheel. Come
back with me, and take it easy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank you, sir, I will presently,” said the
captain. He lifted a hand toward his head
again, but hastily withdrew it. David, watching
him, knew how he felt.</p>

<p class='c006'>Back in the lounge, Dulcie was being entertained
by Walter Cram. He was telling her
far too much, but he didn’t know it. His egotism,
his silly pride, his preposterous vanity
ran over his narrative like an ugly stain, and
through it all a slimy envy of David that
puzzled Dulcie. As soon as she could, she left
him and wandered around until she found Red
Ryan, busy with his eternal testing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you ever stop?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t want to, Miss Hammond. I love it.
Every time I try a screw or test a wire, I
think, ‘Here, you beauty, you can just depend
on Red, who loves you like a sweetheart, to
keep you trim and true.’ And all my fellas
feel the same. We just love the Moonbeam,
and what you feel love for, turns toil into
pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What a man you are!” said Dulcie warmly.
“Tell me, do you always tell the truth?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I try to,” said Red, looking puzzled.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dulcie made the plunge.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well then, why does Mr. Cram hate David
so?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My God!” exclaimed Red, dropping a
wrench, “how did you discover that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He’s been talking to me, about himself
mostly, and he didn’t say a word about David
that you could pin to, but he hates him poisonously.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Honest, Miss Hammond,” said Red admiringly,
“you are one smart girl.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, you know it, too.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I do so,” said Red, “but David doesn’t. Not
he! He’s got more brains and better, than
anyone I know, but no common sense when it
comes to side-steppin’ a rattler.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But why? What’s the answer?” demanded
Dulcie.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How long have you known him?” hedged
Red.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Cram? Oh, two or three years. I used to
go down to Princeton for dances and whatnot.
That’s where I first heard of David. The
three men who dragged me around to rabbles
were friends of his at prep school.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yeah, Butter Brown, and Len, and
Smithy?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Right first time,” said Dulcie. “David has
told you. Well, Wally tried to give me a rush.
Gee, he was a wet smack! And he wouldn’t
take hints. I was bored to tears, and the boys
all offered to take him off and kill him. But
all that doesn’t explain why he has it in for
David.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Visibility increasin’,” commented Red.
“David doesn’t just shun you, Miss Hammond.
That wouldn’t just please Wally. But that’s
only part of it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Speaking in a low tone, he told her how,
almost four years ago, David had passed his
entrance exams to the pilots’ school, while
Cram had failed. He told her a great deal
about Wally, as man and boy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He’s not as bad as I make out, perhaps,”
he finished, “but even as a boy Wally always
magnified every slight or injury to Mr. Walter
Cram, and retaliated on a big scale.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think it’s a shame!” cried Dulcie. “It
makes me have a horrid feeling.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, we’ll just keep an eye out, and see
what we see,” said Red as he went off in search
of a possible loose screw.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dulcie liked Red. She liked his bright smile,
and the twinkle in his blue eyes. She didn’t
care who he was, or whence he came. He was
so true, so merry, and so unassuming that he
could be any man’s friend. Yes, she liked
Red, and she liked David. She certainly did
like David.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the lunch hour the Moonbeam sped
smoothly along at an altitude of one thousand
feet. Dulcie declared that it was like being
on an ocean liner, only nicer. She proved a
joy unspeakable to the young reporters, the
professors regarded her with apparent curiosity,
and even Mr. Hamilton induced her to
talk to him a while. Tea-time was one of the
pleasantest hours of the day. No one suffered
but Koko, the little dog, who stuffed on cakes,
and groaned for hours afterwards.</p>

<p class='c006'>That night the company dispersed very
early. The altitude, the crisp untainted air
and the novelty combined to make everyone
sleepy. Mr. Hammond was in the best of
spirits. Tail winds had helped them on, they
had used all the engines, and were already
three hours ahead of the schedule of the Graf
Zeppelin.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thursday morning, the seventeenth of June,
found the ship sailing serenely along over a
floor of heavy clouds. The sun shone brightly,
and the air was even, but there was a low
humming in the wires that disturbed David.
He found Red in his cubicle, and told him that
he looked for a storm.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I’ve a prickling in my thumbs, too,”
said Red. “And when it comes, it’s going to
be a wow. I think I’ll take a look over the old
boat and see that everything is ship-shape.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He commenced to put on the smooth buttonless
overalls which, with felt shoes, were always
worn by anyone moving about in the
hull. They were designed to prevent any
scratching or tearing of the fabric of the gas
bags and air bags.</p>

<p class='c006'>“God help the man at the head of a gang;
he’s every man’s slave. My crew is made up
of fine efficient fellas, but this trip has gone
to their heads. As soon as they saw themselves
crossin’ big water, they all took out
little notebooks from their kits, and commenced
jottin’ down ‘experiences’.</p>

<p class='c006'>“An’ when I said, ‘You blamed lunatics,
what for is that?’ they told me they were
‘writing it up for the papers at home’! Tryin’
to be a bunch of Lindys, and Byrds, and Strassers.
I simply said, ‘And have I novelists, or
have I mechanics, then?’”</p>

<p class='c006'>David laughed and asked, “Got another
’all?”</p>

<p class='c006'>He slipped into the garment Red threw
him, and together they went up into the hull.</p>

<p class='c006'>That afternoon the motion of the ship became
a little jerky; and David and Red, on
another inspection trip, had some trouble in
making their way over the bags, along the
catwalk, and among the taut wires and spanners.
Occasionally they stood listening to the
talk of the ship, with its multitude of little
mechanical noises which, to the educated ear,
was harmonious as an orchestra.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Singin’ pretty, isn’t she?” Red said finally.
“Hey, there, don’t that wire just in front of
us sag a bit?” He wormed his way over to the
winch and pulled up the offending brace, testing
it until it sang softly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now for the eggs full of engines,” he said,
as he started back, David following.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Honestly, Red, all this isn’t your job,” protested
David.</p>

<p class='c006'>Red turned and stared deep into David’s
eyes. For the first time David saw pin points
of flame in the blue depths. He spoke, and his
voice carried a new note.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Any job’s my job, so be it’s for the Moonbeam.
There’s going to be a blow, Dave.
We’re coming into wind. I have seen too
many ‘northers’ in Oklahoma to make any
mistake. What I want to know is, why don’t
they radio the nearest station and see what
weather’s scheduled ahead.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The receiver’s gone on the blink,” said
David briefly. “That’s why they didn’t get
any messages through.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Saints keep us, that’s that!” muttered Red.
“Well, let’s shove along. I want to see what
the engines are doing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They climbed down into the eggs, one by
one, and Red’s keen eyes took note of every
part of the enormous throbbing engines, each
controlled by two earnest and keen-eyed engineers.
A third man sat on a small stool,
always ready to stand by in case of trouble.</p>

<p class='c006'>Later, as they entered the observation room,
after removing their overalls, Red grunted.
“Everything looks okay,” he said, “but I wish
Miss Hammond was at home in her own house,
instead of bummin’ along up here a mile or
so from anything more solid and endurin’
than a stiff breeze.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’re right,” said David. “Honest, Red,
she is the nicest kid, and such a good sport.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think so,” said Red. “Gosh, did you feel
the car shake then? We struck a crack in the
wind. Yep, Miss Hammond is the real thing,
all right. She is so nice to everybody. Why,
she treats me just as good as she does you,
Dave.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Better!” assented David, bitterly. “Gosh,
there’s another crack! Feel her bounce!” He
was flung against the nearest chair, where he
clung for support for a moment, until the ship
again rode on an even keel. A little tremor
ran through the Moonbeam; she rolled a little.
Several of the passengers who were in the
salon hurried to their cabins to rescue small
articles which might be broken in the event of
rougher weather. Others crowded close to the
windows, watching the scudding clouds with
anxious faces.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fifteen minutes passed, then the ship raised
her nose, reared in a long curve, and swooped
downward. From the galley came the sound
of breaking dishes, followed by a yell of anguish
from the cook. Flung into each other’s
arms, David and Red executed a clumsy dance
about the room before they could get their
balance, as the ship righted and straightened
out again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Whew!” said Red, rubbing the back of his
head where it had bumped against a hook.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I don’t like that so well,” said David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am going to take a squint at that weather
chart, and then look at the rear engine again,”
said Red. “Coming?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Go on,” said David. “I’ll join you as soon
as I put on another sweater. I’m cold.” He
turned and went into his cabin as Red hurried
forward.</p>

<p class='c006'>David had to unpack the sweater, but he
didn’t hurry. He knew that Fraine was on
duty. He slipped on the heavy garment, then
sauntered toward the control room. As he
approached it a yell broke through the monotonous
sounds of the gondola. A hoarse
scream, another, and a jabbering laugh. He
ran into the control room, and for an instant
stood frozen by the sight that met his eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>The wheel was deserted but, caught by its
stabilizing device, held the ship on her course.
On the floor, apparently dead, lay Lieutenant
Florsheim. Just beyond him lay Van Arden,
a crumpled heap face down. Captain Fraine,
his face contorted in an expression of insane
frenzy, held Red Ryan by the throat against
the wall with one hand, while he poised a
heavy wrench for a murderous blow with the
other.</p>

<p class='c006'>At David’s shout, the madman hesitated.
As the iron came crashing down, David
caught the wrist and deflected the blow which
would have cracked Red’s head like an eggshell.
Then ensued an actual life-and-death
struggle. David tried desperately to get a
subduing grasp on the crazed captain, while
Red, rallying his strength, struggled for a
throat hold.</p>

<p class='c006'>The inhuman strength of madness filled
Fraine. David and Red were both tall and
splendidly muscled, yet in his frenzy he
swung them about like children. He centered
his attention on Red, who gurgled as Fraine’s
sinewy hands closed for the second time on his
windpipe. Lights flashed before his eyes. He
choked, sagged, and then all at once it was
over. David had put every ounce of the
strength of his trained muscles into a lightning
uppercut. It landed neatly on the captain’s
chin. He crashed to the floor beside
Florsheim, unconscious.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the door faces appeared: Mr. Hammond,
Mr. Hamilton, a dozen others, among them
Dr. Forsythe. Van Arden was trying to sit
up. Captain Fraine groaned. Florsheim lay
like dead, blood from a gaping wound on his
head spreading on the floor. Red nursed his
swollen neck, and David leaned panting
against the instrument shelf.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fraine has gone crazy, doctor,” said Red
hoarsely. “When I got here Florsheim was
out, and he was trying to kill Van Arden.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Get all three to their bunks,” the doctor
ordered.</p>

<p class='c006'>A swift examination showed that Van Arden
was suffering from merely a heavy blow
on the jaw. All he wanted was peace and
silence, and a chance for his head to stop
whirling. Florsheim was badly hurt, with a
long scalp cut, and the doctor feared concussion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Captain Fraine, on the first approach to
consciousness, evinced such symptoms of
acute delirium that Dr. Forsythe immediately
gave him an opiate.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond came back to the control
room and took the wheel from the still shaky
David. “I will take the first watch,” he said.
“Dulcie has some tea for you and Red in the
salon.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Nothing loath, they walked back and sat
down, as Dulcie, followed by the sputtering
chef, brought in steaming tea and crackers.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dulcie’s little hands trembled as she set the
cups before them. “Drink it,” she said. “It
will fix your throat, Red, and set you up,
David. Oh, wasn’t it awful?” she quavered.
“What did happen?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know what started it,” said Red.
“When I got there, Fraine had done for Florsheim
entirely, and Van Arden was out.
When he saw me, he quit kicking Van Arden
and grabbed me. David was a welcome sight.
Fact is,” he suddenly sobered, “he would have
done for me, Davie. I never saw anything
like his strength. You’d have thought I was
a baby. Why, he was choking me and trying
to tap me with the wrench, all at the same
time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have more tea,” Dulcie shuddered. “And
you, too, David.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thanks, no. I’m all bucked up,” said
David, and left them to go forward.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Take the wheel, David, while I see how
Fraine is,” Mr. Hammond said, as David came
again into the control room. He patted the
boy reassuringly on the shoulder as he went
back toward the cabins.</p>

<p class='c006'>David stared out into the deepening gloom.
The afternoon was nearly gone. A strange
darkness was beginning to surround them.
The ship was again running with the wind,
not smoothly but very swiftly. They were
making nearly ninety miles an hour. He
hoped the wind would hold behind them, but
he felt little cross currents already. As he
watched, he saw far ahead a swirl of black
tossing clouds rise from the cloud floor below,
as though picked up in giant fragments which
wove and blended into a thick tossing barrier.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond returned.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, David,” he said, “it looks as if it was
up to you, now. Things are pretty bad in
there. Doc says there must be a piece of bone
pressing on that head wound of the captain’s
or a tiny splinter working around inside, and
that blow he got at Lakehurst about finished
him. Doc has given him a shot of morphine,
and he is asleep. He says an operation will fix
him up.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Poor Florsheim has a cracked skull, and
needs hospital care as soon as we can make
Friedrichshafen. Van Arden is still groggy.
He will be all right again in a couple of days.
You will have to take charge of the ship,
David. It’s a chance for you to show your
mettle. Show what the school at Ayre can do.
I’m back of you, but while I command the ship,
you steer; understand?”</p>

<p class='c006'>David’s eyes remained on the black curtain
ahead.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, sir,” he said. “And if those are your
orders, sir, I am going to cut down now to a
lower altitude, and find better weather.
There’s a bad blow ahead. See the lightning?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pretty bad, way ahead there,” said Mr.
Hammond, “but you must not try going down.
Heavens, no! Don’t you know that Captain
Fraine was all against that? Go up, if you
must, but not down.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It will be safer below.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can’t allow it, David. We have got to
go by precedent, and not experiment, now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is not experiment with me,” David argued,
forgetting in his anxiety that Mr. Hammond
was his commander. “I have done it on
trial flights, and it worked perfectly.” He
watched the approaching cloud bank. “I
have got to do it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond’s face hardened. “I forbid
it,” he said. “Understand?” and without
waiting for a reply walked away, leaving
David to stare at the ominous clouds, now shot
with countless little veins of flame.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And I am captain and two navigators, all
in one, and in full charge!” said David to himself,
bitterly adding, “Like Mike, I am!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch07' class='c007'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br />THROUGH THE STORM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Dinner that night was a rather somber occasion.
The ship pitched badly, and there was
a good deal of difficulty in keeping the dishes
on the table. When the waiters opened the
door going into the galley, the chef could be
heard calling down curses on the day he had
left home. Mr. Hamilton was silent but stoical,
while his secretary was near collapse.
Wally’s verbosity was turned off like a spigot.
He was green with fear. The reporters were
suspiciously jovial. One of them was constructing
a little model parachute with a few
bits of wood, cloth and string. Questioned, he
said smilingly that he was going to send down
a bottle with a message in it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Doctor Sims remarked gloatingly, “Last
message, I take it, if we are <em>in extremis</em>.
Very interesting indeed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t be morbid, Sims,” said Doctor Trigg
calmly. “Look out for your coffee, and try
some of that souffle. What mortal could possibly
anticipate disaster when the cook can
concoct such a delectable morsel?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gr-r-r-r!” from Doctor Sims, lunging for
the saltcellar as it skated away. “Your mental
attitude, Martin, always inclines to the
flippant and dicacious. Personally, I find the
present exuberant actions of the ship most
distasteful.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There goes your water,” Doctor Trigg retorted
rather unnecessarily, as he held his own
glass in one hand and speared souffle with
the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Grr-r-r-r-ruh,” said Doctor Sims, rising
unsteadily. He went to his cabin to get dry
clothes, clinging desperately to wall and
chairs.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Isn’t he sweet?” said Dulcie.</p>

<p class='c006'>Doctor Trigg studied her. “My dear, you
have given me a new thought,” he said seriously.
“A perfectly new thought. Sims—sweet—well,
well!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The waiters hurriedly cleared the tables.
With growing apprehension, the passengers
clustered at the windows to watch the void
beyond. Intervals of calm, as they passed the
space between two storms, raised false hopes,
for they were soon plunged into a roaring
madness of elements.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then, all at once, they were in a maelstrom
of elemental fury. Above, below, around
them, a gale whined and shrieked. Solid
sheets of water buffeted the ship, while flashes
of lightning were continuous and so vivid that
the control room was bathed in an intense,
livid glare. Here, there, and everywhere
storms gathered, moved upon the ship, and
beat her mercilessly. As the gusts beset her
from all sides, she pitched madly.</p>

<p class='c006'>They were now flying about a mile above
the surface of the sea. Mr. Hammond came
staggering into the control room and stood
near David, but neither spoke.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ahead of them, mountainous clouds, looking
as solid as a wall, rose up as though to block
their path. Rain continued to fall in torrents,
with hail and snow. The thunder roared, bellowed,
and reverberated.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the salon, the passengers huddled in
groups with the stoic acceptance of any situation
that is characteristic of the American
people. Doctor Sims calmly watched the unbelievable
panorama, jotting down an occasional
note by the intense glare of the lightning.
Dulcie clung close to Doctor Trigg, who,
also calm, strove to quiet the girl’s natural
apprehension with little jokes and whimsical
stories.</p>

<p class='c006'>The majority of the crew were in the hull.
The engineers of course were at their posts.
Red, sure-footed as a cat, seemed to be everywhere
at once. The ship quivered under the
lashing of the storm like a live thing. At times
she was lifted more than three hundred feet
above her course, then plunged in a delirious
drop of nearly a thousand feet toward the
sea, before she could be steadied. She seemed
wrapped in solid sheets of lightning. The
duralumin framework was fully charged with
electricity, and tongues of electricity were
being sprayed away from all edges, points and
corners. The cables were glowing with violet
light.</p>

<p class='c006'>David watched anxiously for an opening or
“hole” through the sheets of lightning,
through which he might contrive to drop
down to the possible safety of a lower level.
He was determined to make the attempt.
Each time that they had been tossed upward,
he had found that a worse condition, if possible,
existed in the upper altitudes. They were
still about a mile above the sea. The din was
so great that speech had become impossible.
Mr. Hammond, at his elbow, continually indicated
a rise; but David had reached the place
where, as long as he held the wheel, he would
have to follow his own judgment. So he crept
on, watching with strained eyes for a hole in
the floor.</p>

<p class='c006'>Wally, on hands and knees, had managed to
reach his cabin, where he cowered, utterly
undone. He buckled on a parachute and decided
to jump as soon as the ship turned nose
down. Suddenly he felt a forward inclination;
the ship was certainly tipping. Wally
slid and scrambled into the salon.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Jump! Jump! She’s gone!” he croaked
hoarsely and, reaching the window, struggled
to open it. Like a cat Doctor Sims was upon
him, circling him with thin wiry arms and
legs. Together they rolled on the floor, and
Doctor Sims slapped him smartly on the face.
It brought the nearly crazed man back to his
senses. They sat up, Wally making no move
to escape.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, you amorphous protoplasm!”
screamed Doctor Sims. “You congenital moronic
microbe! You—you unspeakable NUT!”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was too much. As Wally slumped, Dulcie
hid her face in Doctor Trigg’s coat. In the
din, a wild burst of laughter became nothing
but a series of open mouths and contorted
faces. But the tension of terror had snapped.</p>

<p class='c006'>They had run the gamut of emotions, from
the first cold prick of fear to the abandon of
terror, and then to the ridiculous explosion.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was then that David saw a black spot
which might be a “hole.” Cautiously he
turned the trembling ship, and managed to
approach it. He found that it was the haven
which might save them, and carefully maneuvered
her down into the whirling pit. The
storm-tossed craft steadied, and with a great
sigh of relief David lowered the Moonbeam
down and down, into an area of miraculous
calm.</p>

<p class='c006'>Below, the sea had been beaten into a flat
surface by the driving rain. Above, the terrible
floor of storm-tossed clouds had become
a roof, from which hung wisps and threads
of mist. A cold, clean, steady wind drove them
toward the east. Once more David could hear
the beloved, everyday noises of the ship.</p>

<p class='c006'>They were safe.</p>

<p class='c006'>Doctor Trigg patted Dulcie, and looked at
his watch. “Only four o’clock,” he said
cheerily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Four days!” groaned a reporter.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That indicates the inadequacy of time as
we divide it,” said Doctor Trigg, “Eh, Sims?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Get up!” growled Doctor Sims, glaring at
Wally. “And go to your room!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Wally, scrambling up, obeyed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Twenty lines of Latin is indicated, too,
Sims,” said Doctor Trigg, chuckling, “but
don’t be too hard on the poor boy. His reaction
is entirely a matter of temperament.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Doctor Sims rose. “Gr-r-r-r-r!” he retorted,
and dusted his knees.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the control room, David could scarcely
realize that the danger was really past. He
felt weak and shaken.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Give me the wheel,” said Van Arden’s
voice, at his side.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Can you make it?” David asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Surest thing you know!” Van Arden
smiled. “I really am all right again, but you
must be all in, Ellison. Go along. I’ll carry
on.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond took David’s arm. “Black
coffee is what you need,” he said, and led him
into the salon.</p>

<p class='c006'>David rubbed his hands. The fingers were
stiffly crooked. He could hardly flex them,
they had gripped the wheel so long. Dulcie,
calm and collected, appeared from the galley,
and sat down opposite him. She took the cup
of coffee from the pallid chef, and served it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“An egg, and some marmalade and toast, I
think, Cookie,” she said, smiling up into the
plump, worried face. “Now, hero, don’t talk.
Just relax, and get something to eat. Then
you are to go to sleep for a week or so. Dad
says so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, I’m all right, Dulcie,” declared David.
“A little stiff, but that will disappear as soon
as I move around.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Anyway, you are to go to bed. Gee, wasn’t
that storm a whiz-bang? I was never so
thrilled in my life.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where were you?” asked David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Right close to Doctor Trigg,” replied Dulcie.
“He was calm as calm!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are a nervy kid,” said David, admiringly.
“I’m proud of you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, we are all proud of you,” she replied.
“Dad says even Captain Fraine could not have
done better. To tell you the truth, David, dad
feels pretty glum about the way he butted in
and ordered you to make altitude. He says
that he had put you in charge, and that it was
up to him to go by your judgment. And he
says that it was lucky for us you dropped to
a lower altitude when you did. It probably
saved the ship.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And he says, as long as you did bring us
through, he doesn’t regret meeting the storm
one bit. It only proved the stability and
strength of the dirigible. My! By the time
those reporters get through writing it up,
dirigibles are going to be the whole thing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I’m glad the commander isn’t sore at
me for using my own judgment,” said David,
a relieved look on his face. “I just had to do
it, Dulcie.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He isn’t; and of course you had to, and
he’s going to tell you so,” said Dulcie. “Oh,
there comes the sun! Wonderful, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>David turned to the window. Above, the
leaden clouds were breaking up and turning
to fleece—innocent, pretty masses that looked
as though they had been assembled for purely
decorative purposes. The first rays of the
sun turned them faintly pink, and changed
the leaden sea to silver.</p>

<p class='c006'>Just below them, a big liner, looking like a
toy, nosed westward, and as Van Arden
gently dropped the ship to a still lower level,
the steamer sent three puffs of smoke from
her funnels in greeting. No other craft was
in sight. As the sun rose, the sparkle and
brilliance increased. Already a dull smudge
on the horizon revealed itself plainly as the
eastern continent. They sped along at an altitude
of one thousand feet.</p>

<p class='c006'>Someone opened a window, and the sweet
clean air rushed through the salon. Dulcie
buttoned her sweater, and sniffed the air appreciatively
as she gazed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Doesn’t it look happy?” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>David, firmly but kindly escorted to his
room by Mr. Hammond, slept for two blissful
hours. Then he was awakened by his newly-acquired
sense of responsibility, a sense ingrained
in the minds of masters of all crafts,
either of sea or air. He leaped up, perfectly
refreshed, and ready for anything.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond was sitting by the window.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wanted to see you as soon as you waked
up, Ellison, so I came back here to get a little
rest and quiet, myself. You can’t hear yourself
think out there in the salon. All the passengers
are telling their various experiences
during the storm!</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have arranged to leave Captain Fraine
and Lieutenant Florsheim at Friedrichshafen
for hospital treatment. They are pretty sick
men, Dr. Forsythe says. I had planned to
take on someone there to fill Captain Fraine’s
place but, David, I am convinced that you can
do it. After your performance last night, I
am positive that you are capable of handling
any situation.” He rose, his kindly face beaming.
“I congratulate you, Captain Ellison. It
is a big job, but you will swing it!” He shook
hands, and was gone.</p>

<p class='c006'>David stood staring into limitless space.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dad!” he whispered; “are you glad?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The radio was again in working order, and
the operators had sent messages back to Ayre,
and long radiograms were sent to the news
syndicates of New York, Berlin, Petrograd,
and Tokio by the reporters, each eager to turn
in the best story of the storm.</p>

<p class='c006'>David did not see London. They had passed
the ancient city at about six o’clock, while he
slept.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m sorry I missed seeing London,” David
remarked to Dulcie, who wandered into the
control room about nine.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was asleep, too,” said she. “I wanted awfully
to see it. I’ve been reading a book about
the Zeppelin during the war. The English
used to make London pitch black every night
on account of German air raids. They were
able to make the city practically invisible, but
they could not hide the river Thames. That
always gave them away, because the bombers
had plans of every important place in the
city—churches, public buildings, stations,
tanks, magazines, and freight depots—and
they could locate them by the river. Then
down would come a few tons of bombs.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pretty ghastly,” said David. He thought
of the price he had paid for the war, a price
paid by millions, and set his mouth hard. Dulcie
studied his face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“David, did you lose anyone?” she asked.
Her voice was so sympathetic, so tender, that
he opened his heart. He could almost feel
himself flying with his young and gallant
father, as he told her about him, his work,
and his death. It was not a long story as
David told it. When he finished Dulcie’s eyes
were misty.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, David!” she sighed, and impulsively
patted his arm. “Your poor, poor mother!
But how proud you must be!”</p>

<p class='c006'>She hadn’t pitied him. She had understood.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am proud; too proud to broadcast that
I’m his son until I can do something worth
while, myself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“As if you hadn’t done so, already, you nice
modest David! But I won’t tell. Not even
daddy!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Heavens, <em>no</em>!” cried David, giving the
wheel a twist. “Oh Lord! Dulcie—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, shush, silly, as if I would tell! No one
is to know. Just you and me—and Red Ryan.
Why Ryan, Davie?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He guessed it, the darned fox. Nothing I
said. He just picked it out of the air. His
Irish shrewdness, I suppose. Anyway, he
asked me point-blank.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You like him, don’t you, David?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll say I do!” said David warmly. “He
may be rough on the outside, but he’s nobody’s
fool, and smart as a whip, and as loyal as they
make ’em. By the way, where is Cram all
this time?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Dulcie chuckled. “Poor Wally! He’s in his
stateroom, a very sick man.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Honestly?” demanded David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, just all in.” She leaned close and
whispered, “Scared to death, Dr. Forsythe
told daddy. I heard him, and daddy shooed
me away. So don’t breathe it. And see what
he says when he comes out.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You never turned a hair, did you?” admiringly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dulcie shrugged. “Why should I? I have
no mother, and daddy was here, so what was
the difference?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What about your other friends?” asked
David, with a wide blank gaze.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What other friends?” she inquired innocently.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Me,” said David, ungrammatically but concisely.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dulcie blushed; then she chuckled, and
pinched David’s finger. “Well, Funnyface,
you were here too, weren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s more like it,” said David, and they
both laughed. But somehow a new and closer
friendship commenced then.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond, appearing in the doorway,
assumed a scowl.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Go away, Dulcie,” he said, “and let the captain
sail the ship. I’d put you in chains where
stowaways belong, if only I could find any.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They had passed France; they were over
Germany. Radiograms were flying between
the ship and Friedrichshafen. All was in
readiness there for the welcome of the Moonbeam,
and at eleven thirty-five that morning
Friedrichshafen lay below them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Slowly the ship settled over the field. The
ground crew of five hundred men seized the
ropes and, spreading fanwise, brought the
ship down. Mr. Hammond had expected to
be moored to the mast, but he saw that preparations
had been made to house the ship in
the hangar.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the ground crew, resplendent in their
natty blues, drew the Moonbeam down to
earth, the watchers saw a large group of
magnificently uniformed officers waiting to
receive them. Great crowds, held back in orderly
masses by soldiers, roared the deep German salute,
“<em>Hoch, Hoch</em>,” and mingling with
it they could hear a goodly volume of American
hurrahs, while all over the vast field
waved a scattering of small American flags.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond was enthusiastically received
by the burgomaster and a group of the city
fathers, as well as by representative officers
from the German army and navy, air service,
and government. He found himself shaking
hands with his old friend, the American ambassador
to Germany. Smiles wreathed every
face.</p>

<p class='c006'>The joyous uproar continued as all the passengers
came down the steps from the gondola,
but later a sympathetic silence fell as the
waiting ambulance backed up and its white-clad
attendants disappeared into the ship.
Expert hands bore out two stretchers with
their swathed forms. Florsheim, sensing the
sympathy, got his arm from under the blanket
and waved it with a pale grin, while a cheer
burst out again, this time not for the ship but
for the two injured men being given over to
the care of the skilful surgeons for whom
Germany is justly noted. When the ambulance
had gone, the crowd surged toward the ship.</p>

<p class='c006'>The best of German mechanics waited to
assist the crew of the Moonbeam in grooming
her. David, standing at Mr. Hammond’s side,
felt the good fellowship and sportsmanship
which permeated the welcome. The Moonbeam
was trying to surpass the record of their
own Graf Zeppelin, but there was no resentment.</p>

<p class='c006'>One ferocious-looking and red-faced general
in the Air Corps stared hard at David as
he walked away, then exploded, “And where
iss your captain?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is our captain and pilot, general,”
said Mr. Hammond, bowing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gott in Himmel, he iss a poy, chust a poy!
Do you Americans set children, then, to sail
your ships?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not quite, general,” answered Mr. Hammond,
smiling, “but Captain Ellison is one
in a million; a genius in his chosen field. We
lost the services of our captain and first pilot
on the way over. The captain went—well, he
became very ill from the effects of an old
wound, and the pilot sustained an injury. We
are leaving them both here in the hospital.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A terrific storm was approaching at the
time, and I was obliged to put young Ellison
in charge. He handled the ship like a veteran.
I am convinced that his cleverness and good
judgment saved it, in fact, and I have made
him captain for the entire flight. I have absolute
confidence in him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fine, fine!” exploded the general heartily.
“I congratulate you. Good bilots are born,
and nod mate. You are luggy.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch08' class='c007'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br />THE CRADLE OF THE ZEPPELIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>He watched the retreating back of the
young captain under discussion with the wise
eyes of a man who can read men.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yess, he looks goot,” he added.</p>

<p class='c006'>They were driven to a hotel, and escorted
to luxurious rooms.</p>

<p class='c006'>The lobby was full of young officers, strutting
and clanking around. Mr. Hammond and
David looked distinguished in their plain,
close-fitting blue with black braid and small
gold insignia which had been chosen as the
ship’s uniform. They were both very tall
men, well over six feet, the muscles of the
younger man making up for the middle-age
weight of the older. The Germans regarded
them with interest and respect. Certainly
they were not to be looked down on, at least!
Dulcie, watching them, thought with fury of
her own fairylike proportions. How she pined
to be a Brunhilde, stalking firmly among all
these arrogant-looking young men!</p>

<p class='c006'>Having changed her frock, Dulcie went to
find her father. She found him in his room
struggling with a tie, while at the same time
he regarded a long, official-looking document
on the chiffonier.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just look at this, Dulcie.” He handed her
the paper. “A state luncheon at one-thirty,
for a starter, and from then on not a minute
that isn’t taken up. It’s a little better for
you, but I bet every last one of these officials
has a nice husky wife who will look after you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll let ’em look for a while, but sometime
I am going to play truant. I want to see
Friedrichshafen my own way. Isn’t it beautiful?
And it was here that Count Zeppelin
lived, and worked out his plans. I want to
learn all about him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, you ought to learn all you can about
him, Dulcie. Of course, Santos-Dumont was
the first one seriously to struggle with the
problem of the rigid dirigible, but Count
Zeppelin went far ahead of him. Come in!”
he added in a roar, as a knock sounded at the
door. A bell boy, apple-cheeked and rosy,
presented a large tray piled with envelopes.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond groaned.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Look ’em over, will you, Dulcie; we only
have fifteen minutes, but you are all ready.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Dulcie gave a little laugh. “Why, a lot of
them are for me,” she cried, beginning to tear
them open. “You were right; they are from
the wives. And oh, such high-sounding titles!”
She shuffled her notes into a pile. “I’ll read
them later.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The troublesome tie finally in place, Mr.
Hammond put on his coat, smacked down his
thick white hair, and they descended to the
lounge, where a delegation awaited them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The burgomaster met them with a long address
of welcome, to which all the Germans
present listened attentively, as though to
show that they approved thoroughly. Dulcie
studied their heavy, intelligent faces. Across
the weatherbeaten cheeks of a number of the
older men ran jagged scars. Newer, livid
seams puckered the faces of a couple of the
younger officers, brands from Heidelberg
duels. Young and old alike stood straight,
feet firmly planted, heads proudly poised on
their thick necks.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They are glad they are men, and Germans,
and want everybody to know it,” thought
Dulcie.</p>

<p class='c006'>The luncheon was a heavy meal, punctuated
by heavy speeches and encored by heavy
voices barking “<em>Hoch, hoch!</em>” appreciatively.
Mr. Hammond enjoyed every moment of it.
The utterances of those clear, keen, lucid
minds were well worth listening to, especially
as he spoke German fluently. Dulcie, also
easily conversant with the language, was
greatly interested; but David was lost. His
French was fairly good, although of the prep-school
type, but the guttural polysyllables of
the Germans left him gasping.</p>

<p class='c006'>After the luncheon came a drive, which was
in reality a parade designed to show the visitors
to the inhabitants of the city. Hundreds
of people had come from Berlin and elsewhere
to see the great American dirigible, her officers,
her crew and her passengers. Every hotel
and boarding house was filled to capacity. To
the German mind their advent was an educational
opportunity which must be followed up.</p>

<p class='c006'>The procession wound up at the landing
field where the visitors were shown all the
latest improvements on the German dirigibles.
New materials for frame construction, covering,
and so forth, all under severe tests of
every possible sort.</p>

<p class='c006'>This airport was the home of the first Zeppelin.
It was here that Count Zeppelin spent
his time and energy; a wonderful old man,
who defied age and went gallantly on, working,
planning and constructing, until at last
he had the great happiness of tasting success.</p>

<p class='c006'>They were taken to Count Zeppelin’s office,
left as he had used it. The walls were covered
with pictures of dirigibles and photographs
of engines. Otherwise the room was bare and
severe, the room of a man whose whole heart
was so entirely in his great work that he
found no space for non-essentials. His name
is justly revered and honored by every German,
and never while a dirigible flies will any
country fail to pay homage to his illustrious
memory.</p>

<p class='c006'>That night, after a formal dinner given at
the airport in a great banqueting hall, they
listened to the Friedrichshafen Choral Society.</p>

<p class='c006'>Next morning, Dulcie slipped away and explored
the city. She was a tireless walker,
and her pleasant wanderings took her over
miles of clean and charming streets. The
business part of the town was lavishly decorated
with flags and bunting in their honor.
Everyone seemed to move with a snap. There
were no loiterers. Robust people did robust
work, as though they enjoyed it.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the outlying parts, an exquisite neatness
prevailed. Small, even humble homes, had
their patches of lawn and tiny vegetable plots
that were as lovely as rose gardens, so beautifully
were they laid out and cared for. Every
building seemed fresh with paint.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Even the skies look awfully blue,” Dulcie
told herself. “Just like the babies’ eyes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Her wanderings were delightful; the people
were so friendly. They seemed to know, down
to the least little toddler, that the pretty fraulein
had come in the beautiful airship, for
there were pleasant greetings for her wherever
she went. A cheery “<em>Guten Morgen,
Fraulein</em>,” and as likely as not a posy offered
over a fence. When they found that she spoke
their own tongue, they would scarcely let her
go.</p>

<p class='c006'>She reached the hotel just in time to prepare
for a luncheon given for her by the
Friedrichshafen Association of Housewives.
She found numbers of stiff and crackly ladies,
from bright-eyed old grandmothers proudly
wearing the fashions of forty years ago, to
demure brides with soft eyes and pleasant
voices that almost made the German gutturals
pleasing. Dulcie had a good time, and when
she took leave of her cordial hostesses was
presented with a souvenir. She thought it
was a small feather bed, but it was an eiderdown
quilt! It was a lusty quilt, fully six
inches thick, and covered with intricate patchwork,
the handiwork of the energetic grandmothers.
Dulcie was completely overcome.</p>

<p class='c006'>All that afternoon Mr. Hammond and his
staff spent at the landing field, where the
Moonbeam was being looked over, inch by
inch, by her own crew and the German experts
as well.</p>

<p class='c006'>To the surprise of all, two small holes, not
larger than lead pencils, were found piercing
the very tip of her nose. Inside, the metal
was fused! She had been struck by lightning
during the storm. The injury was soon repaired.
Oil and gas were shipped, every bag
looked over, and every instrument tested for
the long flight over the Siberian wastes.</p>

<p class='c006'>David thrilled at the thought of this part of
the flight. It was largely unknown territory,
where there was no aid to be had in case of
accident. With Red, he himself went over and
over the ship, until they knew that she was
tuned up to concert pitch.</p>

<p class='c006'>At five, the party started for Berlin. The
city is only forty miles from Friedrichshafen.
After a fine dinner with the city officials and
a number of officers, they went to the opera,
where boxes were reserved for them. David
stood in the back of the commander’s box,
admiring Dulcie from afar. She was completely
surrounded by a group of dashing
young lieutenants, who were utterly captivated
by her beauty and charm.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was twelve o’clock before the last strains
of Wagner’s immortal theme died away, and
they were escorted to a supper, after which
they drove back to Friedrichshafen, Mr. Hammond
and the older of the German officers
sleeping quite openly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Friday was their last day in Friedrichshafen,
and Mr. Hammond was himself host
at a luncheon. There was great good fellowship,
and a loud chorus of German songs. The
crew of the Moonbeam had gone to the landing
field, where they were eating much food as
the guests of the German crews. Directly after
Mr. Hammond’s luncheon had come to an
end, he found a chance to speak to David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How much gas did you put on?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ten thousand feet,” said David promptly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did they varnish the propellers?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, sir. Everything is in order. We
could start in ten minutes if necessary.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think we will go shortly after ten. Most
of these people whom we know, with a million
or so more, want to meet us at the field and
say <em>Auf Wiedersehen</em>, so we must not go
ahead of time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We have had a great reception, haven’t
we?” said David. “To a shy little country
boy like me, it has been rather overwhelming.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Huh!” said Mr. Hammond, “I’m reeling in
my tracks. By the way, when have you seen
Florsheim?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was up at the hospital early this morning,
and once yesterday. I will go say good-bye
before I leave for the field. What rotten
luck that was, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A mean break,” agreed Mr. Hammond.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think poor Florsheim feels pretty low
over it. He is enough better now to think a
little.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have you seen Fraine?” asked the commander.
“They just let me look in on him
after the operation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, I haven’t seen him, but it really doesn’t
matter, because it will be days before he
knows anyone. Poor old Fraine! I certainly
hope the next time I am captain, there won’t
have to be a war staged to get me the job.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m sorry about Fraine, and Florsheim,
too,” said Mr. Hammond, “but it was an accident
that might have occurred wherever
Fraine had happened to be. And as far as you
go, David, well, boy, I am well satisfied with
you.” He patted David’s shoulder in a way
that added value to his brief praise.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wonder where Dulcie and the professors
are,” he continued. “I hope they haven’t gone
off on some jaunt of their own. I clean forgot
to tell them that we are going out in a powerboat
to see the lagoons and the coast line. See
if you can find them, will you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>David ran the quarry to earth in the lounge.
Doctor Sims had just heard of another very
old graveyard some distance from the city,
but the others succeeded in persuading him to
postpone indefinitely his contemplated pilgrimage
thereto, for the lesser pleasure of an
afternoon on the water.</p>

<p class='c006'>The launch was a gorgeous thing, with mahogany
planking and silver fittings. It was
a calm day, and the water was scarcely broken
by a ripple. The launch shot through the
water at furious speed, and the young naval
officer, whose guest they were, asked Mr.
Hammond if he cared to go faster.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, I don’t think so, thanks. I am rather
timid, you see.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A general laugh went up.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How cruelly the commander must suffer,
six thousand feet in the air,” laughed the
host.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s different,” said Mr. Hammond,
laughing at himself. “There is something so
upsetting about this.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They went slower after that, and were able
to see the beauties of the sea and shore line.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This actually makes me want to be a poet,”
mused Doctor Trigg.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are one, dang it!” said Doctor Sims,
violently.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Me? Why, I never wrote a line of poetry
in my life!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You do worse; you think it. I can feel it
stewing around inside of you. If it wasn’t
for me, Martin, you would just be another
nuisance to humanity. But I choke you off—I
choke you off!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now that’s kind of you, Nicholas, but this
scene ought to be excuse enough for anyone.
Even you, Nicholas. How does it make you
feel? Be honest!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Doctor Sims reflected.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Like a normal human being,” he said.
“Nice day, nice boat, nice scenery, much
obliged to our host. Doesn’t that cover everything?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Doctor Trigg laughed heartily. “Sims,” he
said, “you are a ‘gem of purest ray serene’.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There—you—go!” said Doctor Sims.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” said Dulcie, “it seems to me that
you each say the right thing, always.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank you, my dear,” said Doctor Trigg.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Har!” said Doctor Sims.</p>

<p class='c006'>Long shadows spent themselves across the
lagoon as they returned to Friedrichshafen.
Mr. Hammond and David, accompanied by
their host of the afternoon, were driven at
once to the hospital, where Mr. Hammond
gave last instructions for the care of his two
officers. Back to the hotel, then, and at seven
dinner was served.</p>

<p class='c006'>The many bells in the city had struck nine
before the company rose. Dulcie and David
wandered out into the lobby.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gold lace,” remarked Dulcie, glancing
about. “Did you ever see so much of it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Someone told me that there is much less
than in the days of the Empire,” said David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, it must have been sewed all over
them,” sighed Dulcie. “It must be heavy stuff
to wear.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What do those huskies care for a little
weight more or less?” demanded David.
“Gosh, they are big fellows!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They are no larger than you,” said Dulcie.
“And very little larger than Red, and daddy
is taller than a lot of them, but not so thick.
Only Wally looks small.” She giggled
wickedly. “Really, doesn’t he look funny?
The way he scowls, and stares up at them!
But then,” she went on gloomily, “look at me!
I’m shorter than Wally. See how I have to
look up at ’em.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yeah; they love it. But at that Wally isn’t
so short; he’s just about a scant average. The
rest of us are all so big. Why, when I was a
kid, I used to worry for fear I would be too
big to fly.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Children are funny, aren’t they?” agreed
Dulcie. “Here’s our car; let’s go out to the
field. I’ll tell daddy we have gone.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She leaned back in the car, with a sigh of
relaxation.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It has been wonderful, hasn’t it? Surely
they won’t be half as glad to see us in Tokio.
Here, of course, they feel a great interest on
account of the Graf Zeppelin. And of course
she did blaze the way; we are just beating her
time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If we can,” hedged David. “We mustn’t
crow. We are three hours behind her time,
now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We will make it up,” said Dulcie, easily.
“Oh, David, I have so many cares. I have
shipped home all the lovely presents people
here have given me, but I can’t express the
live stock.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Koko?” asked David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Koko! Heavens, no! I wish it was Koko.
David, I have two love birds, four German
Roller canaries, a kitten, and a marmoset.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A marmoset!” repeated David. “Why,
that’s a monkey, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“A very little bit of a one,” said Dulcie,
groaning. “One of those aviators gave it to
me. He brought it over from Africa one day.”</p>

<p class='c006'>David howled. He laughed so hard that
people looked around at <em>der grosse Amerikaner</em>,
who was making so much noise.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, won’t it be fun when your father sees
that menagerie? The air will be just full of
love birds, and monkeys, and rolly-canaries,
and kittens.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are showing a cloven foot,” she said.
“Don’t you like pets?”</p>

<p class='c006'>David sobered down.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Truly, I do, and I could be happy forever
if I could have a couple of love birds, and some
canaries, and a kitten, and you—your marmoset,”
he added quickly, warned by Dulcie’s
prim mouth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s better, big boy, and when we get
home perhaps I will give you some of them.
The marmoset, and maybe my best love—bird!
But now,” she added, all too briskly,
“we’ll soon be back on the Moonbeam. I’ve a
lot to do, and there will no doubt be thousands
of <em>tüchtiger</em> officers, waiting to say <em>Auf
Wiedersehen</em>.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch09' class='c007'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br />EASTWARD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Returning to the effulgence of the landing
field, they found that preparations were well
under way for their departure. David went
at once to headquarters, where he was to join
Mr. Hammond and the other officers. Dulcie,
dodging her <em>tüchtiger</em> officers, found Red, and
had an earnest talk with him. When they
parted, Red was shaking with laughter, and
Dulcie, looking as though she was the kitten
and had just eaten one of the canaries, went
back to find the bereft Germans, all of whom
hastened to assure her that they were coming
to America immediately.</p>

<p class='c006'>At last everything was ready, and at one
forty-five the ship was walked out of the
hangar. Good-byes were said, thanks exchanged,
passengers counted and they rose,
accompanied by cheers, waving handkerchiefs,
and the furious blasts of a brass band. As
the Moonbeam gained altitude she was followed
by a giant spotlight that held her in a
dazzling arc of radiance, up, and up, and up
until the ray grew dim and was left behind.</p>

<p class='c006'>Beautiful, bright Friedrichshafen was a
memory, and Sunday, the twentieth of June,
was over. David found Dulcie writing in
the salon, and whispered, “Has he seen ’em
yet?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Seen what?” asked Dulcie.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The menagerie, of course.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, it’s gone,” said Dulcie, calmly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gone! Gone where?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I hated to bother daddy, it’s so bad
for his digestion; especially after all those
German dinners. So I just farmed every one
of ’em out. The crew has the marmoset, the
reporters have the canaries, Red is taking
care of the kitten, and best of all, Doctor
Trigg has got the love birds. So it’s all fixed.
Pretty clever of me, don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, Dulcie,” said David as soon as he
could stop laughing. “And I’ll tell the world
I’m learning about women from you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” said Dulcie reflectively, “I’m not so
bad, at that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>All conditions were perfect for flight, and
the Moonbeam sailed gently along through
the still clear night. David, standing the first
watch, was alone but not lonely. Guiding his
ship, planning his future, the “thoughts of
youth” were “long, long thoughts,” and
happy ones.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Van Arden came to take the wheel,
David gave it over reluctantly. He could not
sleep. The greatness of their enterprise was
growing on him with every hour; all the
marvel of it. Behind and over him were
human beings; the passengers, officers, and
crew, all sleeping serenely and confidently in
this immensity of space. Europe was slipping
by beneath them. Somehow David discovered
that its civilization and its eager
interest in their progress was a comfort, a
spiritual safeguard. Now, indeed, they were
about to fare into a wild and savage country,
where there were no hangars, and no materials
for repairs. No landing crews would
swarm over the Siberian wastes to seize the
ropes and ease the stranger to the earth,
should she desire to come. Ahead was Russia!
The fierce recluse of the world, with
her ragged mountains and her endless barren
plains.</p>

<p class='c006'>Long before dawn, David went again to the
control room, where he found Mr. Hammond
reading the log.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We passed over Berlin at three-thirty,
David,” he remarked. “If air conditions remain
good, and we continue making seventy-five
miles an hour, I think we can make up
some of our lost time today.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m sure of it,” replied David, “especially
if the wind stays with us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Monday dawned. It was a glorious soul-shaking
dawn that appeared from nowhere,
and without warning drowned the ship in
splendor. As David watched, Dulcie came
quietly to his side.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Look, Davie!” she said. “See all those
banners of gorgeous color. Don’t they look
like endless lengths of silk, waving and billowing?
And there are little silver ribbons, and
all those chiffon clouds. See over there that
deep orange and lavender, shading into rose
and blue.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll drop down,” said David. “Perhaps the
earth is all dressed up, too.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Slowly the Moonbeam lost altitude, sinking
gently through the riot of color.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Very dressy indeed,” Dulcie commented,
as they gazed down at the ordered luxuriance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Funny everything over here looks like it
had a clean white collar on. Even the woods.
And see those farms. See the people waving.
I suppose they are shouting, too.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Look, there’s one little speck running for
the house,” cried Dulcie. “I’ll bet they have
a telephone, and he’s gone to tell the neighbors
in the next village about us. See, there
is a group of houses away ahead.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Quite a little settlement. By George, you
are right! Look in the square. See them
come? I am going down a bit closer.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They watched, and Dulcie waved madly.
Below, the little toy people waved their arms
and hats. Even aprons were torn off and
brandished. A fat old man bowled about,
waving and bowing with an air of authority
easily discernible to the amused watchers
above. As the ship passed on, children and
dogs followed in a losing race.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wasn’t that fun?” said Dulcie. “You are
nice, Davie. It is so understanding of you to
know how they feel. That is the thrill that
comes once in a lifetime for a lot of those
people. And they wanted us to know how
glad they were to see us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course they did, and now they are telephoning
ahead to other villages, and getting
no end of a kick out of us. I will sail as low as
I can, so they can see us plainly. They’ll be
watching for us all along the way. Do you
know, miss, that it is time for breakfast?
Where do you suppose the commander is?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll get him,” said Dulcie, “and then we’ll
eat.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She ran off as Van Arden, giving intangible
signs of just having eaten a good meal, came
in to take his turn at the wheel.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond was already eating a substantial
breakfast, arguing hotly the while
about politics with Wally, who displayed a
positive genius for saying infuriating things
in an innocent and courteous manner. Mr.
Hamilton and his secretary sat by a window,
where Mr. Hamilton drank black coffee and
ate unbuttered toast while he gazed spellbound
at the shifting panorama below. Doctor
Sims, at a table by himself, drank strong
tea and read a treatise filled with unwholesome
looking charts and figures. At a table
with Dr. Forsythe and the correspondents,
Doctor Trigg sat listening to the rapid fire of
wit and slang and mild profanity which
flashed from one to the other. They were full
of anecdotes of their stay in Friedrichshafen,
and the tales did not lose in the telling. But
all stopped talking to greet David as he came
in.</p>

<p class='c006'>“’Morning, captain!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hi, captain, what’s our next thrill?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“David, how are you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Dulcie smiled. David was liked by everyone.
No one could resist his brilliant smile,
his thick rumpled hair that never would stay
flat, his tall muscular body with its reassuring
look of power. And David’s eyes, with their
little laugh creases at the corners, were
straight and very true.</p>

<p class='c006'>He came in, greeting everyone at once with
a manner which made each one feel that the
pleasant word was especially his. It was
characteristic that he noticed Doctor Sims
sitting alone, and took a place at his table.</p>

<p class='c006'>The doctor responded to David’s pleasant
good-morning with a growl which was almost
cheerful. Doctor Trigg and the star reporter,
a keen-looking, gray-haired man, soon joined
them. Doctor Sims closed his book with a
baffled air. He never got enough time for
research work, and he laid most of his interruptions
to Doctor Trigg. Drat the man; he
was always close by, ready to chat. Chat—who
wanted to chat? What if they had been
classmates in the long ago, and co-educators
ever since? Why, by all the test tubes in the
world, should a man as learned and profound
as was Doctor Trigg in his chosen sphere, why
should he want to chat?</p>

<p class='c006'>Doctor Sims did not wait. He leaped upon
his quarry.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yar-r-r-r-r-r,” he quoth forcibly. “Yar-r-r,
Martin! What is your latest discovery this
morning? More enthusiasm? More youthful
prodigies, or more astonishing propensities?
Let’s hear ’em, and get it over with.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, no, Sims, I can’t say that I have
anything profound or of specific value to
offer for your consideration today.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How did you like Friedrichshafen, Doctor
Sims?” asked the star reporter. He was
a friendly man.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wonderful, wonderful!” said Doctor Sims.
“I ransacked the city and miles of its
environs. I found rich returns for my labor.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He’s a collector,” explained Doctor Trigg
to the reporter.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Epitaphs,” added Doctor Sims proudly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ep—” said the reporter, and stopped.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Precisely,” said Doctor Trigg. “Ep-itaphs.
On monuments, you know:</p>

<div class='nf-block-c0'>
  <div class='nf-block'>
    <p>
    ‘Here lieth the body of Israel Jones,<br />
    Till Judgment Day shall uncover his bones’.”
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“A very poor imitative effort on your part,”
said Doctor Sims caustically.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It was just a sort of sample,” Doctor Trigg
defended his effort. “I will be willing to
wager one of these excellent doughnuts that
these young men, collectively, have never read
six epitaphs in their lives.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I haven’t,” confessed David, his sunny
smile full on Doctor Sims’ gloomy countenance.
“I bet they are interesting. You could
sure get a kick out of some of them. Like
collecting stamps.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Much more enthralling, much more appealing.”
Doctor Sims pushed back his teacup
and book. “It’s like this: Paleontologists
have found that from the most remote
antiquity—”</p>

<p class='c006'>Doctor Trigg interrupted. “Nicholas,” he
said, “it is a pity to embark on a subject of
such widespread interest at so inauspicious
a moment, when you will certainly be obliged
to discontinue your discourse before you have
voiced a tenth of your thesis. Let me advise
you to reserve your dissertation for a time
when these young men will have finished their
duties and be free to assure you a couple of
hours of uninterrupted attention.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He looked solemnly at the reporter, who
looked solemnly back.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That would be better, doctor, if you don’t
mind. I’d hate to miss it, and I’ve got to dash
off pretty soon, and make out my reports.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Doctor Sims looked almost pleased. “All
right, all right, and I will get my recent additions
transcribed and cataloged, and the
snapshots developed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just where are we, captain?” asked Doctor
Trigg, hastily taking up a new subject.</p>

<p class='c006'>David explained. “We must be approaching
the border of Russia, now,” he added. They
crowded to the window.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What wonderful scenery!” exclaimed the
star reporter. “It is growing much wilder
and more rugged. Even those plains over
there look harsh, and cold.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They watched a gradual change take place
and about ten o’clock they saw ahead a city
which they knew must be Tilsit, East Prussia.
They dipped low, and went slowly over it,
while the populace surged out of buildings in
black masses. They had been heralded by
telegram and radio, and cheers went up, and
flags were waved. When they hung over the
public square, they dropped a bundle of postcards.
Dulcie, hoping some child would pick
it up, dropped a handkerchief with an
American quarter tied in the corner.</p>

<p class='c006'>Winds continued favorable, even and
strong, and due east. They were now going
seventy-five miles an hour, and were gradually
making up some of the time lost in the
storm over the Atlantic. All conditions
seemed so kindly that David actually felt
nervous. He watched the instruments, and
tested the feel of the wheel every few
minutes.</p>

<p class='c006'>Luncheon came and went.</p>

<p class='c006'>At about two o’clock, when the passengers
were enjoying the passing view, someone
exclaimed, “City ahead!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is Dvinsk,” said Mr. Hammond.
“Friends, we are now crossing the Soviet
frontier.” He stood watching until the city,
some miles to the right, had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We are in Russia,” he continued. “Leningrad
and Moscow are ahead, but our course
lies between them. Viatka is directly in our
line of flight, about six hundred miles east of
Moscow.”</p>

<p class='c006'>David, still impressed by the size and loneliness
of the country they were entering,
slipped on an overall, and went up the ladder
leading into the hull. He gained the catwalk,
and made his cautious way along the narrow
foothold that ran the entire length of the hull.</p>

<p class='c006'>Reaching the end of the walk, David looked
over the intakes of the fuel and water lines,
which entered there. Everything was in perfect
shape. He went back, and looked into
the baggage room and then into the storage
rooms for the cartridge-like cases of fuel gas.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then he went down to Red’s cabin. Red
was writing postcards, aided and abetted by
the kitten.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hello, fella!” he cried. “Come up to see
me cat? Ain’t he a beaut? You can tell he’s
a cat at first glance, small as he is. Now a
pup at that age might turn into anything between
a dachshund and a Great Dane. Those
seem to be the most popular breeds in this
country. But a cat—well, a cat’s a regular
cat from its first breath. Just a soft bundle
of mews, and scratches, and devilment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did Miss Hammond tell you, now, about
how those little German bands gave her a
menagerie? She farmed ’em all out on us. I
think she’s partial to me, Dave, because she
gave me the kitten. I suggested lettin’ Wally
take care of the bit of a monkey, but she said
she wouldn’t ‘trust to his finer feelings’. She
didn’t make it clear whose she meant; just
twinkled those devastatin’ eyes at me, and
walked off, leavin’ me with this bit of fur.
I’ve named him Trouble. He cries in a loud
voice when I leave him, and I daren’t let him
out for a second. Imagine those claws
sprinting up a gas bag. So I spend most of
my idle moments here, just to hearten him.
But if you want fun, go see the crew and their
share of the menagerie.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, Mr. Hammond will inspect around
here some fine day, and then we will be in
wrong,” warned David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not a bit! Just the first roar, and Miss
Dulcie will slip up the way she does, and she
will say, ‘Why, they are mine, daddy, and
these nice men are keeping them for me,’ and
I’ll bet we will each get a medal.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Likely to be that way,” said David, laughing.
“Do you see much of Cram lately?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not so much. He sort of keeps to himself.
I cross his path every little while. Gosh,
Davie, the truth is I’m tryin’ to keep from
giving him a sock.” Red sighed. “He’s my
one bad dream.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t see why you take him so hard,” said
David. “You sound as though he had grabbed
off your best girl.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, of course he did that,” admitted Red
easily. “With their first oil well. But that’s
nothing. I always manage to have a few
spares. It’s nothing like that. He did other
things. Well, I won’t hit him unless he harms
you, David, really tries to do you dirt. It’s
the nasty way he has of sayin’ things that
makes him dangerous. Not so much the
things he says, but the way he says ’em.”
Red shrugged his shoulders as though to rid
himself of an unpleasant subject. “Say, how’s
your little gadget comin’ on these days?”</p>

<p class='c006'>David’s face lighted.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s finished, Red, as far as it can be without
a working model. You know, I feel as
though I had stumbled on something darned
good. Gee, I hope it wins that school prize.
Ten thousand dollars! Sounds good, doesn’t
it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good enough,” said Red, “but none too
good. You know I’ve a sense for engines, and
everything that concerns them and I’m telling
you, you’ve got a great thing there.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think so, Red. I’m like you; I feel pretty
sure of it. I didn’t have that feeling for any
of the other things I rigged up. I didn’t seem
to have much interest in them, though they
worked. You know, they are using a couple
of them back at the plant, right now. But
this is different. From the minute the principle
of the thing flashed into my mind, I
liked it. And think what it would mean to
dirigible transportation!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll say! It ought to increase the average
speed of a dirigible fifteen to twenty per
cent.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If it works,” hedged David cautiously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, it’ll work! If we hadn’t come on this
trip you could have tried it out before this,
couldn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It will keep, and there will be plenty of
time. It could be made in twenty-four hours,
if necessary,” said David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, don’t let anything happen to the
plans, and keep them under your hat,” advised
Red.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You bet,” said David. “Do you know that
we are over Russia now?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yeah! We crossed the frontier while I
was down in an egg looking at an engine. One
of those engineers is bugs on geography, and
he spouted enough facts about Russia to fill
a book. I’ll say they have some mad looking
country, haven’t they? But not many people
so far. Towns kind of scattered.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wait a day or two,” David prophesied. “I
have a hunch that this is Central Park to
what’s ahead. Can you leave the cat long
enough to look things over a bit?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Red assented, and felt exploringly under
his pillow. He brought out a small can.</p>

<p class='c006'>“God help me, I even have to steal condensed
cream for me cat!” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>Monday evening passed uneventfully. During
the night the Moonbeam encountered a
skirmish of winds which she rode so evenly
that there was scarcely any discomfort on the
ship. The instruments, however, as well as
radio reports from Irkutsk, Chita, and
Chabarovsk in Siberia warned them of thick
and uncertain weather ahead.</p>

<p class='c006'>Viatka was passed at ten minutes after ten
Tuesday morning; and with daylight appeared
the grim, austere peaks of the Ural
Mountains. As the light became clearer, the
mountains emerged from their enveloping
fogs and reared their bleak monstrous crests
as though reaching for the passing ship. The
panorama was of surpassing grandeur. At
ten-thirty they sailed over the city of Kisel.
Here they approached as low as was safe, and
dropped several sacks of mail.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cold biting winds from the Arctic buffeted
them. Overcoats, sweaters and mufflers appeared,
but the elements could not keep the
awed sightseers from the windows, where
they watched the slow march of the Titans
below. Their speed was reduced for safety’s
sake here, for the winds were more and
more uncertain. The mountains covered
a vast space, but the general trend of the
range was northeast, the direction that the
Moonbeam was gradually following. About
the base of the mountains were dark blots of
forests, but they covered little of the great
areas, bald, repellent, and threatening, that
looked from the ship as though carved of
solid stone.</p>

<p class='c006'>They passed several tiny hamlets. To their
surprise, the inhabitants observed the ship
with unfeigned terror. They left their huts,
looked, and one and all took refuge in the
surrounding woods. With the glasses it was
easy to see their terror as they fled, mothers
carrying babies, and small children being
dragged ruthlessly away to safety by agitated
fathers.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What fools!” said Wally to Dulcie.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t think so at all,” she replied hotly.
“I suppose in their place you would know all
about us by instinct? I am just as sorry for
them as I can be.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The squally winds over the mountains were
beginning to be very apparent. They could
feel the Moonbeam struggle against the intermittent
gusts. Later the wind settled into
a steady gale. The five great engines were
doing their utmost, but the ship hung in the
air as though anchored. David raised her to
a higher altitude, but at three thousand feet
above the mountains the wind still tore with
a velocity against which they could make no
headway. He dropped back and tried a
southerly direction, but met with heavy
squalls. Resuming their first course, he held
the Moonbeam steady, her nose to the blast.
Finally the wind, while keeping its intensity,
began to come in gusts. Between them, David
worked the ship north, turning nose on when
the hurricane redoubled its fury. Slowly, with
infinite care and patience, he maneuvered the
ship high above the rough mountains, until he
saw the plains far below.</p>

<p class='c006'>With the stone peaks of the mountains past,
he dropped down to two thousand feet, where
he found comparatively smooth sailing.
Working his way, he steered the Moonbeam
at an angle which brought her into the course
she had left hours before. The wind still blew
hard, but the ship again made headway
against it.</p>

<p class='c006'>As they proceeded into lower country,
plains appeared, many of them dotted over
with clusters of lakes, some vast in size,
others tiny pools. It was bitterly cold. They
were well north of sixty degrees latitude,
which runs just south of Seward, Alaska.
During the night they touched the Arctic
Circle.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch10' class='c007'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br />BANZAI!</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>As the mountains flattened out, the ragged
plains seemed to stretch in inconceivable distances.
Dense uncharted forests blanketed
the land. Two forest fires were raging in this
district, about fifty miles apart. Heavy
masses of smoke hung over them, or were
torn into shreds and hurried away by the high
wind. Bursts of flames reddened the smoke,
and licked greedily upward.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Dulcie went to bed, she experienced
the ever-recurring thrill to find herself in a
luxurious stateroom, far above the earth.
The rarefied clean air made her body tingle.
Dulcie thought shudderingly of her narrow
escape from being left behind.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It only goes to show,” she told herself,
“that occasionally one has to act.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The following morning, Wednesday, after
breakfast, Doctor Trigg and Doctor Sims
stood gazing at the waste below them. “Endless,
arid plains,” said Dr. Trigg. “Russia—Siberia—the
steppes—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wonder just where we are,” said Dulcie,
suddenly bobbing up at the window under
Doctor Sims’ arm. He removed the arm.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I believe we are about seven hundred and
fifty miles west of Yakutsk,” said Mr. Hamilton,
speaking from his usual place at the desk.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is that a city?” asked Dulcie.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yakutsk,” said Doctor Trigg, “is the principal
city of the Lena Gold Fields, and lies
over the Stanovoi Range, toward the western
end of the Sea of Okhotsk. In this part of
Siberia lie the vast gold fields known as the
Russian Klondike. They produce, with incredible
hardship and labor, over two hundred
million rubles annually. A ruble,” he added,
rolling an affectionate and whimsical eye at
Dulcie, “is at present worth—hum—let me
think—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“About fifty cents,” said Mr. Hamilton
promptly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” continued Doctor Trigg. “This bleak
and terrible country, stretching on, desolate
league after desolate league, has been unofficially
the death chamber of thousands of
political and criminal prisoners every year.
Herded together, the lowest and highest, in
horrible proximity, sometimes in chains, the
poor wretches are sent here from civilization
to work the mines for a ruthless State, to
labor, suffer, and die. Often the keenest,
cleverest intellectual, whose only crime was a
chance word, misstated by some jealous contemporary,
is chain-mate to the vilest wretch
crawling. No redress, no pardon. The poet
Shelley pictures Prometheus chained to a
rock, the fox gnawing at his vitals, and
Prometheus groans,</p>

<div class='nf-block-c0'>
  <div class='nf-block'>
    <p>
    ‘No rest, no change, no hope;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I endure.’”
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, conditions are said to be pretty bad,”
mused Mr. Hamilton. “And this is called the
storehouse of the world.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“True,” said Doctor Trigg. “The mountains
contain not only gold, copper and iron,
but ninety-five per cent of all the platinum in
the world. For you, little Dulcie, and for
millions like you, for that delicate chain on
your neck, and that pretty ring.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Costly enough,” added Doctor Sims
gloomily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There are jewels to hang on your platinum
chains, too. Stores of tourmalines, chrysoberyls,
and lovely pale aquamarines hide in the
Urals.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And the endless trickle of bloodstained
gold and gems seeps slowly out, year after
year and generation after generation, to
trick and beautify and amuse the world,” said
Doctor Sims. “Gr-r-r-r-r!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“History repeats itself forever,” said Mr.
Hamilton.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There are other riches, too,” Doctor Trigg
went on. “North of us, as I make out our
present position, lie vast deposits of unmined
oil. Whole lakes of it have escaped from the
earth, and have spread over acres of sodden
ground.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hmmm,” said Wally. “Something ought
to be done about that, if it’s so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is not officially substantiated,” said Doctor
Trigg, “but an old student of mine, who
turned out to be a globe-trotter, told me that
he had actually seen several of those lakes of
oil. He said they were a remarkable sight.
He made various tests, and reported that the
oil in Siberia seems practically limitless.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, we will need that oil some day,” said
Mr. Hamilton. “Question is, what will we
have to pay for it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gr-r-r-r-r,” said Doctor Sims. “Before
that time comes, the face of civilization will
have assumed some new grimace, and the
question will answer itself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, it’s a perfectly horrid country,” declared
Dulcie.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, yet lonely and savage and remote as
it is, it has contrived to paint a few garish
pictures on the page of time. Look at the
Gobi Desert, far south of us. Read of Marco
Polo’s journeys there; his terrific adventures,
about the year 1272, when—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Marco Polo,” interrupted Doctor Sims.
“Why go back to Marco Polo for interest?
Think of our own Roy Chapman Andrews,
and what he has discovered there. Think of
those dinosaur eggs! The Peking Man!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I read about those,” said Dulcie brightly.
“But do you know what we have done? We
have talked and talked all morning. Here
comes luncheon. Oh, Doctor Trigg, you
simply know everything!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gar—yah!” said Doctor Sims, cryptically.</p>

<p class='c006'>Doctor Trigg looked at him over his glasses.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I should know almost everything, my
dear,” he agreed. “You see, I have been
closely associated with Doctor Sims here for
forty years, and having a retentive memory,
I have been able to collect and assimilate a
vast amount of information.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Chops,” said Doctor Sims to the waiter.</p>

<p class='c006'>The wind was lessening, and the Moonbeam
was steadily picking up speed. At seven
o’clock that evening they passed within thirty
miles of Yakutsk, lying toward the southwest.
The evening went gaily. Dulcie brought out
her mandolin, and the youngest reporter confessed
to a guitar. There was singing, too,
and Doctor Trigg surprised everyone with a
knowledge of the words of about every college
song ever written. He sang them, too, in a
lusty, wabbly old voice, happily oblivious
of Doctor Sims’ “Ha’s,” “Humphs” and
“Gr-r-r-r-rs.”</p>

<p class='c006'>At two the next morning, Thursday, they
reached the Port of Ayan, on the Sea of
Okhotsk. They had safely gained the eastern
coast of Asia. At breakfast that morning,
Mr. Hammond was elated.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We have made up all the time we lost in
the storm over the Atlantic, in spite of the
winds over the Urals,” he exclaimed. “We
will surely make a lot crossing the Pacific—eight
hours, at least, if we have good weather,
and another two crossing the United States
will put us in Lakehurst eight hours ahead of
the flying time of the Graf Zeppelin.”</p>

<p class='c006'>David shook his head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I hate to have the chief set his heart on
such a record,” he said to Red, as they later
went forward to the control room. “You
know we won’t have that much luck.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If we do, it sure will be luck,” said Red,
skeptically.</p>

<p class='c006'>The passengers seemed rather glad to leave
the trans-Siberian part of the flight behind
them, although it had been a wonderful experience.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Dulcie succeeded in cornering her
father, she declared that Davie was growing
very thin. She rebuked her parent for the
amount of responsibility he had placed on
David’s shoulders. Finally he replied:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Look here, little gadfly, if you will stop
buzzing for a while, I will explain my methods.
This young David Ellison is rather
better than the average, (‘Much,’ said Dulcie.)
and he has a good mind; an excellent
mind. (‘A perfectly wonderful mind,’ muttered
Dulcie.) He’s a splendid type of the
young American, (‘Um,’ said Dulcie.) and I
want to see if he has the stuff in him that I
think he has. If it’s there, Dulcie, I mean to
give him a helping hand.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Atta boy, daddy!” cried Dulcie. “He has
got brains. Has he said anything to you
about the invention he is working on?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not a word; what is it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He doesn’t want anyone to know about it,
and I’m not to breathe a word even to you,
but it is something about something to fasten
on the engines that will make them do something
or other a great deal better than they
are doing it now, and all that. It is marvelously
important, and I’m not to mention it to
a soul.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wouldn’t. Some unscrupulous person,
hearing you talk about it, might jot the whole
thing down and get a patent on it. In the
meantime, to go back, I won’t be able to find
out what stuff he’s made of unless I work him
like the devil. So keep your finger out of this
pie, Miss Hammond. The young man is not
your type, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is my type, then?” asked Dulcie,
curiously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, there’s Cram.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Daddy,” cried Dulcie, stamping, “I can’t
bear the sight of him!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Can’t bear—well, what were you doing the
other night when I came in to the salon, and
found you at that corner table, holding his
hand, and Cram smirking and blinking at you
like a hound pup?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Dulcie giggled. “I was reading his palm.
I told him he would have a very distinguished
career, and would probably fill some high public
office. I said I thought he would be an
ambassador.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ambassador, my eye!” he growled. “What
do you do it for, anyway, Dulcie, smearing it
on like that?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They expect it. If you don’t kid ’em along
they don’t know how to talk at all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, we will hope for the best,” said Mr.
Hammond, and added, as he left her, “Go
vamp Doctor Sims. If you can get one real
compliment out of him before we reach Ayre,
I’ll buy you a new roadster.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Darling!” cried Dulcie, making a dash for
her parent. But he shut the door hastily, and
was gone.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond went to the chart room,
studied the maps, then joined David in the
control room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, it won’t be long now, before we are
over Japan,” he remarked. “We will probably
spend two days there at the airport, for a good
overhauling.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There are some recent radiograms in that
clip, commander. I see that they are planning
a regular blow-out for us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond commenced looking over the
pile of radiograms which David had indicated.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, well!” he exclaimed. “They have arranged
for six expert engineers to meet us
and take care of the ship. Two Americans,
two Germans, and two Japanese. That is
certainly doing things up right. And there
is a ground crew of five hundred Japanese
sailors, specially trained. Just what they did
for the Graf Zeppelin. They want to know
just when to expect us. Here are advance
greetings from all their princes, highest ranking
army and navy officers, and state officials.”
He sighed. “Well, captain, it does
look like a big reception.”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was a thrill of excitement on the
ship. Everyone was conscious of it. After
the days spent crossing Siberia, the thought
of disembarkation in beautiful, alluring
Japan was delightful. The reporters clicked
their little portables in a chorus which
sounded like hail. There was much joking
and laughter. Doctor Trigg practiced sentences
out of a Japanese-English phrase book.
Doctor Sims, who had once been in Tokio,
knew of an obscure little burial-place that he
meant to visit.</p>

<p class='c006'>At three-thirty o’clock, on Thursday afternoon,
they passed over Mororan, on the island
of Kokkaiddo, Japan. They were now only
five hundred and fifty miles from Tokio.</p>

<p class='c006'>While the Moonbeam sped toward the city,
her five engines roaring out their rhythmic
chorus, there was bustle and excitement in
Tokio. Another great ship, larger by far
than the Graf Zeppelin, was to be the guest of
Japan. The city was in gala dress. From the
highest official, dignified and unapproachable,
down to the tiniest little Geisha girl, chattering
behind her fan, the population of Tokio
united in a charming spirit of welcome. Every
hotel in the city was crowded with tourists,
come to see the ship. The veteran Commander
of Communications, with Mr. Hammond’s
message of acceptance of the entertainments
planned by the city officers, proceeded with
his elaborate arrangements. Special trains
waited at the Tokio station to transport the
two thousand invited guests to the naval
landing field at Kasumigaura, about forty
miles northwest of the city, where an arm of
the Pacific forms placid lagoons.</p>

<p class='c006'>Every hour special weather reports were
wirelessed to the ship, while six seaplanes
were ordered to meet her at sea and escort her
in. The great hangar had been cleared for
the reception of the visitor, the Japanese ships
being transferred to another location.</p>

<p class='c006'>Kasumigaura was not housing an American
ship for the first time. It had been used on a
previous successful round-the-world flight of
three army planes in 1924, but the American
aviators had flown in the opposite direction,
with a more southerly general course.</p>

<p class='c006'>All Thursday morning a distinguished
group of Japanese watched the five hundred
bluejackets who comprised the special ground
crew as they rehearsed for their coming task.
There was the admiral, the minister of the
navy, the vice admiral, and, besides, two
princes of the reigning house. The ground
crew used the largest of the Japanese dirigibles
for their maneuvers.</p>

<p class='c006'>The weather was hot, but beautiful and
clear. All nature seemed in league to show
Japan at its loveliest. At Tokio, as the morning
passed, thousands of tireless eyes searched
the sky for the first sight of their splendid
visitor. Afternoon came, and dragged by,
and still the masses of people watched and
listened for the siren which was to sound the
tidings of her arrival. Newsboys swarmed
everywhere, with extras containing the latest
reports of the ship’s location.</p>

<p class='c006'>Evening came. Nine o’clock; fifteen minutes
past; and then—three long blasts from
the city’s sirens sent men, women and children
rushing for vantage points. Traffic
came spontaneously to an end.</p>

<p class='c006'>She had come; the silver ship, the Moonbeam!
Her engines roaring, her silver gray
sides gleaming in the searchlights, she appeared
suddenly as she dropped through a
floor of mist, and hung so low over the city
that it was easy to see the passengers crowded
at the windows of the cabin. The usual calm
of the Japanese disappeared, and wild shouts
of “<em>Banzai!</em>” rent the air. Handkerchiefs
waved madly.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Moonbeam hung low over the city, as
though waiting to receive the homage due
her. Then graciously she circled, and crossing
the center of the city, sailed across to Yokohama,
where she saluted the outgoing
steamers which were awaiting her there.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then she turned in the direction of Kasumigaura.
Reaching the port, she made a wide
circle, her attendant seaplanes following, then
descended. The ground crew rushed to their
places, and with perfect precision the Moonbeam
was drawn down and secured.</p>

<p class='c006'>The crowd, composed of many nationalities,
became wildly excited. The noise continued
while the passengers disembarked. Mr. Hammond
and David were immediately surrounded
by a group of bemedalled and gold-laced
officials. Their luggage was put in cars
which were to take them to Tokio, where
rooms were reserved for all the passengers
and officers at the Imperial Hotel. Dulcie
clung close to Doctor Trigg, with Red Ryan
as a bulwark on the other side, and Cram close
in the rear. Soldiers and policemen tried to
hold back the masses of people who seemed to
gather in increasing numbers. Repeatedly
the laughing, chattering mobs broke through
the cordons, only to be pressed back.</p>

<p class='c006'>A large automobile swept up to Dulcie and
her escorts, and a Japanese officer motioned
that they were to enter. When they were
comfortably seated, and the door shut, the
smiling Oriental bowed and the car rolled
smoothly away in the direction of Tokio.</p>

<p class='c006'>The great yellow moon came lazily out of
the sea, and lanterns twinkled merrily as they
sped along.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, Lafayette, here we are!” said Dulcie,
leaning back on the luxurious cushions. “This
is certainly a dandy car. Red, I feel a grand
good time coming on.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You betcha, Miss Hammond!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t like these Japs,” said Wally, turning
around on the front seat, where he sat
beside the chauffeur. “They are two-faced,
and undependable. Wouldn’t trust one an
inch.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Keep still!” Dulcie cried imperiously.
“That man may speak English. Anyway, I
don’t believe one word of it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Wally subsided into sulky silence. The little
man at the wheel did not flicker an eyelid.
Dulcie decided that he had not understood.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did you notice the charming little incident
back there when our friend closed the door?”
asked Doctor Trigg delightedly. “Knowledge
is indeed power!” He tapped the little
Japanese-English phrase book in his hand. “I
had the pleasure of speaking to the young
man in his native tongue. I wish you had
noticed the surprise and interest depicted on
his countenance. He seemed scarcely able
to believe his ears. I am rather an old man to
attempt the mastery of a new tongue.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What did you say, doctor?” asked Dulcie.</p>

<p class='c006'>He stared uncertainly at the little book.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I would refresh my memory, but the light
is so bad. Can you read it? It is the first line
on the left-hand page.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Dulcie snapped on the dome light, and
looked. She could well imagine the amazement
of the young Japanese!</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have stolen the rice of my honorable
father,” was the translation beneath the
phonetic pronunciation. She closed the book
hastily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think you are just too smart for words,
doctor,” she said.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c007'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br />A STUDENT PRINCE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The Imperial Hotel afforded the travelers
every conceivable luxury, perfect service, and
cosmopolitan meals. Dulcie found her room
a bower of flowers. She had her personal
maid, a demure, slant-eyed little thing. Little
Kamani did not seem to sense any handicap
in the fact that neither could speak the other’s
language. Smiles made easy contact.</p>

<p class='c006'>Very early the following morning, the lobby
was filled with important-looking Japanese,
all in immaculate European clothes. Only in
their homes, or on very special state occasions,
do the modern Japanese wear the beautiful
kimonas of the old regime. Many of the men
present were members of the Imperial household.</p>

<p class='c006'>As Dulcie stood talking to Doctor Trigg,
Wally joined them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, Dulcie, how do you like this crazy
country? The people—aren’t they a riot?
And they take themselves so seriously, too.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Keep still, Wally!” said Dulcie, hotly. “I
think you are perfectly inexcusable, the way
you air your views.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They don’t understand,” said Wally carelessly.
“Sort of half-witted, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c006'>At that moment a young Japanese who was
standing directly behind Wally turned to look
at him. As he did so, he saw Doctor Trigg.
A look of amazement flickered across his
placid countenance. He stepped quickly
around the group, and with an apologetic bow
to Dulcie, hastened to the doctor with outstretched
hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Doctor Trigg!” he exclaimed in fluent English.
“Well, well, what do you think of this?
Fortune attends me!” He shook the doctor’s
hands, and almost embraced him. “Surely
you remember me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I most certainly do,” exclaimed Doctor
Trigg. “Well, my dear boy, this certainly is a
delightful reunion. Of course I haven’t forgotten
you!” He turned to Dulcie. “Let me
present to you one of my old and most promising
students.” He hesitated. “What’s your
title over here, Hata? Prince, I believe?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Prince bowed deeply to Dulcie.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Cram, Prince Hata.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Again the Prince bowed; but this time it
was a haughty salutation, and his black eyes
regarded the smiling countenance before him
curiously. He turned abruptly to Doctor
Trigg.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You came in the Moonbeam, I take it, sir.
How delightful! I have already paid compliments
of day to your distinguished young
captain. Do please consider yourself most
particularly my guest during your stay; and
Miss Hammond, if she will be so gracious,
must meet my honored mother and my sisters.
And you must see something of our Tokio;
not this make-believe Paris, but the old city.
For it still exists, hidden away. And I have
a million questions to ask you, Doctor Trigg,
about Princeton.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Doctor Sims is in the party, too,” said the
professor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Truly, this is the happy day of fulfilled desires!”
exclaimed the Prince.</p>

<p class='c006'>Wally broke into the conversation. Here
was a prince! He had heard that the Japanese
nobility were very exclusive. What an
incident to tell back home! Doc calling him
“my dear boy,” too, and patting him on the
back. It was time he asserted himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m a Princeton man, too,” he said, smiling
ingratiatingly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Prince Hata looked at him pleasantly. His
face did not change, his voice when he spoke
was gentle and courteous.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed!” he said, but Wally felt as though
a sizable pail of ice water had been dumped
over him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where is the dear doctor?” Hata asked,
turning to the older man. “Does he still roar
horribly? Such a bluff! And does he still
collect—what is it? Oh, yes, epitaphs. I will
make him very happy. We have some wonderful
ones near the temple on my father’s
estate. Shall we go and find him?” He turned,
and they started out. Wally pressed close to
the young nobleman, but at the door Hata
faced him, and bowed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good-bye,” he said distinctly. “It may be
that we shall meet again.” He turned and
joined the others, who had gone forward.</p>

<p class='c006'>Walter Cram gazed after the trim, dignified
little figure. He felt the hot flush of mortification
in his face. The darned Jap! he had
heard every word he had said in the lobby.
He wondered if the chauffeur of the night before
had also understood English. There was
the big car waiting at the curb. Wally’s
curiosity drove him on. He crossed the sidewalk
and spoke to the driver.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Are you detailed to look after our party
today?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, sir, for the duration of your stay,”
came the instant answer in perfect English.</p>

<p class='c006'>Wally turned and went into the hotel. He
found his way to the men’s lounge, and to a
big wing chair in a corner. There he sat and
thought, cursing himself for his breaks.</p>

<p class='c006'>Prince Hata and the two old men talked of
the days, only two or three years back, when
Hata had been at Princeton. It had not occurred
to either of them that they might see
this former pupil, and here they were, walking
slowly up and down, arm in arm. But
here the two who had been teachers, and
therefore in authority, were the guests, and
Hata, talking fast, was planning all sorts of
wonderful entertainments for them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Prince Hata and his two old teachers
started gaily off to look at temples and jade
and epitaphs. Hata had even remembered
epitaphs! They would have a grand time, and
it was easy to see that Prince Hata was hungry
to hear all about Princeton.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dulcie found her father and David in close
consultation in the reading room, while near
the door half a dozen Japanese officers waited
patiently for the conversation to end. This
was no place for Dulcie. She went down to
the lobby again and found Red, scarcely
recognizable in white suit and shoes, his coppery
hair painstakingly flat, his eyes bluer
than ever.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I certainly am glad to see you!”
Dulcie exclaimed, dragging him toward two
big chairs in a corner. “Such a time!” and
she told him about Wally and the Prince.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Honestly, Miss Hammond, that lad makes
me just sick with disgust, but what can be
done? There’s no chance to lock him up, and
there’s no use warnin’ him to keep a civil
tongue in his head, because he just don’t know
when he’s insultin’. Gosh, what do you suppose
he said and did at Friedrichshafen, when
no one was with him? I dunno, but I bet it
was awful. And he speaks good German, so
he could make all his friendly comments as
clear as sea-water, and as bitter.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I’m too ashamed for words,” said
Dulcie. “Last night in the car I know that
chauffeur understood what he said. These
people are so perfectly and beautifully polite;
so gentle, and self-effacing, and yet so efficient.
You must meet Prince Hata, Red. He
simply oozes aristocracy, yet Doctor Trigg
hugged him and called him his dear boy, and
now he’s taken them off to find old jade and
tombstones. And that man last night who
put us in the car. He never smiled when dear
Doctor Trigg spouted his Japanese at him.
He was so proud of his Japanese and, Red, he
had looked at the wrong line in the book! He
thought he said ‘Good-night, and thank you’,
but he had said, ‘You have stolen the rice of
my father’!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“God love him!” cried Red, after a shout of
laughter. “He said that, did he?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, and the man just smiled politely and
bowed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, Wally is just the cross we’ll have to
bear, Miss Hammond.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We won’t worry over him, at any rate,”
Dulcie replied. “I’ve a grand morning ahead
of me. I’m going to take Kamani, my little
maid, and an interpreter, and lots of money,
and we are going shopping. Imagine it!
Shopping in Tokio!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It looks just like New York to me,” said
Red, “except for the people.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not where we are going. We are going to
explore. Here they come now. Good-bye!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good luck!” said Red. He went off to find
David, and met him coming down the grand
staircase.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How about a drive, Red?” he called as soon
as he caught sight of him. “I’m free for the
rest of the morning, and we might see something
of the city.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fine!” agreed Red. “I believe that the car
that brought Miss Hammond and the professors
in last night is assigned to us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good!” cried David.</p>

<p class='c006'>They located the car, and found the same
young driver at the wheel.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You speak English, of course?” David said,
his candid eyes smiling.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yess, sir.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thought so,” David said. “Well, how
about a drive this morning? We are crazy
to see the city, and I bet you can tell us all
about it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It will be to me a great happiness,” the
young Japanese answered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come on then, Red; we’re off!” They
hopped in and the car started smoothly away.</p>

<p class='c006'>A short distance from the hotel, their driver
called to a youth who was standing at the
curb. They conversed in a chopped sibilant
jargon, then the driver asked permission to
take on another driver, so that he himself
might be free to designate and explain points
of interest.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course,” said David. “And you had
better come over in back so you won’t have
to shout.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He came readily enough and sat on one of
the little folding seats, with many apologies
for occupying a place in front of them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then began such a story of Japan and of
Tokio that the past lived and the present blossomed
for them. The Japanese, he said, had
never been a roving people. They did not live
by conquest. Japan’s rulers are well beloved,
guiding their industrious subjects with kindly
wisdom, as they forge ahead in agriculture
and the arts on a high plane of civilization.
Centuries ago, while all the rest of the world
was new and racked by conflict, civil and foreign,
the Japanese were taught to read and
write.</p>

<p class='c006'>They drove through miles of streets as modern
as the newest of American cities. Block
after block of beautiful office buildings and
shops with great windows full of the most up-to-date
gowns and Paris ties, socks, and shirts.
Snappy gloves laid over correct walking sticks
that would have been a credit to the most exclusive
Fifth Avenue shop. There were magnificent
banks; and movie houses everywhere.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How big is this place, anyhow?” Red demanded
at length.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They say it is a good bit bigger than Philadelphia,”
said David. “And Philly is some
town, you know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It was strange indeed to see on all sides such
perfect order and co-operation in a land so
crowded that it was impossible to spare room
for the domestic animals, the horses and cows
so common to the rest of the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>Their guide dwelt upon the thousands of
students, men and women, who had gone
abroad to be educated, and to absorb new and
advanced ideas, until Japan in her stupendous
mental growth had supplied her people
with universities and technical schools of
their own. He showed them silkworms on
their trays in warm rooms, endlessly eating
the mulberry leaves heaped about them. They
saw skeins of queer raw silk, and were given
a strand for a souvenir.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then they went down to the wharves; and
saw the agile little fishermen on their slow-moving
boats.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Those boats look nice and peaceful,” said
Red, staring at a dark, sullen ship.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Their dreadnaughts, over at Yokohama,
are not so peaceful. They have to have ’em
for protection,” said David. “All countries
have to have protective navies.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They sure looked as though they could
protect, all right.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We will try to go to Yokohama,” said the
guide, “but not today. Not plenty enough
time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Driving a little way beyond the city, they
saw tiny farms, perhaps two and a half acres
in extent, all under the most intensive cultivation.
On the way back they entered the old
part of the city, where they saw temples lovely
as dreams. They went through small shops,
where men were decorating exquisite pieces
of porcelain, painting on silk, or carving precious stones,
ivory, and teak.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Take me home,” moaned David at last, as
he paid for just one more purchase. “I
mustn’t buy another thing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But they are so cheap,” murmured Red,
arranging a whole procession of tiny elephants
and regarding them with fascinated
eyes. “I’ve a notion our lad here keeps a
critical eye on the price tags. These storekeepers
are always castin’ eyes at him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, take your elephants, and let’s go. I
know you are going to buy them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“This has been simply great,” David told
their guide when they arrived at their hotel.
“I never had a better time in my life. Thanks
a lot. I wish you would tell us your name.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The young man hesitated. “It iss most
hard to speak it, that name,” he said, “but in
your America, iss not Bill the often name of
the chauffeur?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The boys laughed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yeah, it’s American, all right,” said Red.</p>

<p class='c006'>“All right, Bill,” said David as he shook the
young man’s hand heartily. “Whatever you
say goes. Thanks a whole lot for the ride, and
everything. Gee, it’s been wonderful!”</p>

<p class='c006'>In the lobby they found Mr. Hammond waiting,
as the Moonbeam people drifted in by
twos and threes. The last to appear was
Prince Hata, piloting his two professors.
Doctor Trigg was wreathed in smiles. Doctor
Sims, looking almost sprightly, clutched his
precious notebook and a small parcel.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, well, here’s our pretty girl!” said
Doctor Trigg, smiling at Dulcie. “Thanks to
Hata, here, we have had a wonderful morning—wonderful.
If we were obliged to leave
Japan now, at once, I should still feel repaid
for the journey. Our old pupil has done so
much for us,” he patted the Prince fondly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It would be many times impossible for me
or mine to do enough for you, sir. I was such
a stupid boy, and you both were so always
patient.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tut, tut, Hata, you always had a very retentive
mind. Well, Miss Dulcie, I saw a little
trinket, which Hata secured for me, and I
have brought it to you. I want you to accept
it with an old man’s affection.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Ha—grr-r-r-r-r, same here!” said Doctor
Sims, dropping his parcel into Dulcie’s lap.</p>

<p class='c006'>She opened the quaint worn metal cases.
In each nestled a jewel of purest jade; a necklace
from Doctor Trigg, and from Doctor
Sims a bracelet. Dulcie had never seen anything
quite so lovely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, you dears, you shouldn’t have done it,”
she sighed, brooding lovingly over the jewels.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mere trifles,” said Doctor Sims. “I think
Hata, here, beat the shopkeepers down.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Prince Hata smiled. “They received their
price,” he assured them. “Quite most satisfactory.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Dulcie looked at him suspiciously. She
knew a little about jade. But the dark face
was bland and impassive. After all, whatever
Hata had done, he had done to give happiness
to his two old friends. Dulcie rallied a
diplomacy equal to his own. “They are perfect,”
she said. “And I love you both for
them. I shall keep them all my life, and remember
how I came by them, and what they
mean.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We have a most old saying in Japan, Miss
Hammond,” said Prince Hata. “‘The jewel
is never so lovely as the wearer.’ I mourn
that I shall not see you again today except in
my capacity as official. There is a garden
party to stroll into this afternoon, and tonight
enters a great dinner. Afterwards an entertainment
for the officers and crew. You
might enjoy to go. It is permissible. The
Geisha girls will dance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tomorrow, Miss Hammond, I do trust that
you will graciously allow my mother to receive
you. She is unfortunately unable to
leave her home. If you would so benevolently
come to her?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I would love to,” cried Dulcie.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank you. Then I will so arrange, and
send you word.” He made his cordial, graceful
farewells and departed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, Prince Hata’s mother must be a
princess,” mused Dulcie.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She is the Emperor’s aunt,” said Doctor
Trigg, absently.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Aunt!” cried Dulcie. “Aunt! Then Prince
Hata is the Emperor’s cousin!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Quite likely,” said Doctor Trigg. “I say,
Sims, those manuscripts Hata showed us—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, what have I let myself in for!” cried
Dulcie, interrupting. “I don’t know how to
behave before emperors’ aunts.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pshaw!” laughed Mr. Hammond. “Don’t
forget that you yourself are the heir of the
ages.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Certainly!” said Doctor Trigg. “Besides,
she is a very agreeable old lady. A trifle ceremonious,
but very agreeable. We dropped in
this morning.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“To see the Princess?” demanded Dulcie.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” said Doctor Trigg. “Unofficially, of
course, unofficially. The old lady does not give
audiences to men as a rule, but we were her
son’s teachers, you see, and she seemed to have
an idea that she wanted to thank us personally
for the attention we had given him during his
course at Princeton. Hata took us to the
palace to see some manuscripts. She heard
we were there, so she sent word for us to drop
in and see her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Simple, like that,” murmured Dulcie.
“They just dropped in!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond laughed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“By the way, Dulcie, did you know that
Mr. Hamilton has left us? He had to get back
to Paris by the quickest route. He’s flying
to Baku, then to Moscow, then straight over.
He has to attend a big directors’ meeting of
their Paris house.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What a shame!” cried Dulcie. “Goodness,
daddy, I’m glad you aren’t a big business man.
It’s no wonder they get ‘tired’, is it?” she
added wickedly.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c007'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br />CUSTOMS AND COSTUMES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Dulcie dressed for the luncheon that was
being given for her by the Japanese Vassar
Club, and was immediately driven away to
their club house by the faithful Bill. The men
of the party had a luncheon at the Aviation
Club, an important function because both Mr.
Hammond and David were to be presented
with decorations. Already Mr. Hammond
wore two gorgeous medals presented to him
in Friedrichshafen. David glittered in a
slightly smaller way and it embarrassed him
very much.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the party from the Moonbeam entered
the club, they saw that a large number of very
high ranking officials were present. Most of
them being older men, they did not speak
English, so the speeches of the hosts and the
replies of the guests trickled through the
medium of an interpreter. Aside from that
drawback, and the presence of glittering orderlies
standing behind the chairs of the Japanese
generals and ministers, they might have
been dining at any first-class hotel at home.</p>

<p class='c006'>The young officer on David’s right spoke
only a few broken words of English, but
beamed and smiled so brightly that David
wished he could communicate with him in
some common tongue. Suddenly he thought
of an almost forgotten knack of caricature
which had always gone over big at school.
He brought out a pencil and on the back of
the menu drew, with a few sharp strokes,
pictures of Mr. Hammond and the others, not
sparing himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>They were very funny. He set them forth
on the top of a fat and wobbly blimp with
sagging hull. Each one of them was looking
through long field glasses toward a point
marked with a rising sun. The young Japanese
laughed heartily and handed him another
card. On the bottom of this David drew a
small, distant glimpse of the landing field at
Kasumigaura. The eager visitors were shown
dancing on the top of their unwieldy ship,
and from each mouth issued a balloon inscribed
“<em>Banzai</em>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>David was not sure that the idea would get
across, but it did. The clever sketches traveled
around the great table, and with the
laughter they called forth the stiff decorum of
the meal lightened into a more free and
friendly atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c006'>Helping each other as best they could, with
gestures and drawings, David managed to tell
the group of young aviators about him many
things concerning aviation in America that
they were very anxious to know.</p>

<p class='c006'>The luncheon lasted far into the afternoon.
The ceremonies attending the presentation of
the medals were long and dignified. When
the big, glittering, bejeweled bauble had been
pinned on Mr. Hammond’s coat, with many
suave and pleasant words from the donors,
and when Mr. Hammond had replied with
thanks and prophecies for the welding of nations
through aviation, David felt his muscles
tighten. Now he would get a medal pinned
on him, but he wouldn’t have to speak. He
hadn’t spoken in Friedrichshafen, so why
here? When his name was spoken, he went
to the head of the table, where he stood facing
the highest ranking officer of the aviation
corps in Japan. David stood very straight
and stiff, his broad shoulders squared, his
head high. He was very handsome—and exceedingly
embarrassed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The general, medal in hand, began to speak,
slowly, so the interpreter could keep pace with
him. To David’s consternation, the general
referred to David’s youth and to the fact that
he had taken over the ship in the teeth of a
hurricane, and had brought her to safety. He
congratulated aviation and America on possessing
such a fine young pilot. David felt his
very ears growing red. Then the medal was
pinned on his breast, and behold, it was the
twin of Mr. Hammond’s.</p>

<p class='c006'>Released at last, David somehow gained his
seat, and dropped into it. He looked at Mr.
Hammond. That gentleman was signaling
him to get up. David drew a long shuddering
breath as he rose.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, my Lord!” he breathed, and with his
voice croaking with fright he launched into
his first public speech.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your Excellencies, and gentlemen,” he
commenced: “I don’t know how to thank
you for your kindness. I really don’t deserve
it. The Moonbeam is so staunch that she
could just about take care of herself. She’s
a wonderful ship, and I hope you will soon
have one like her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“<em>Banzai! Banzai!</em>” cried the Japanese.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This is a wonderful experience, being here,
and I hope it will not be my last flight to
Japan,” David continued. “You are all so
kind. I only hope that many of you, indeed
all of you, will come to America as soon as you
can so that we may have the opportunity of
returning, at least in part, your many courtesies.
We will show you our landing fields.
They are very large, most of them, but we
have nothing as beautiful as Kasumigaura.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thank you again for the honor you have
shown me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Somehow he found himself safe in his
chair, with applause all about him. On his
breast the medal winked and flashed. It
fussed him greatly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Someone nudged his elbow. The lieutenant
in the next seat held a card under the edge of
the table. On it his new friend had tried his
hand at drawing. A huge, very Japanesque
figure with wide shoulders and something,
supposedly the uniform of the Moonbeam,
loosely encasing his form, stood smiling
widely. Covering his breast was a medal. At
either side a group of pigmies all ejaculated
“<em>Banzai!</em>” David recognized himself under
the queer Japanese features, and shook
with laughter, to the great delight of the
artist, who was so pleased with his own cleverness
that David made him a present of his gold
pencil as a souvenir.</p>

<p class='c006'>At four o’clock they were all driven to the
garden party given on the grounds of the Emperor’s
palace. David was in Mr. Hammond’s
car.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, David, how we do glisten!” said the
commander as they took their seats. “Don’t
talk to me after our escorts come aboard, as I
am afraid it isn’t polite. I was proud of you,
my boy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gosh,” said David, “I thought I’d go right
plumb through the floor! I never made a
speech in my life. All dressed up like a band
wagon, too. Do I dare take this breastplate
off?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Heavens, no! We’ve got to wear ’em on
every occasion as long as we are here. Why,
David, it’s a tremendous honor.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, sir; I suppose so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Quiet does it now. Here come the others.
Unfurl your brightest smile,” and Mr. Hammond
turned to the officers approaching the
car.</p>

<p class='c006'>The host at the garden party was the Emperor’s
personal representative, the Minister
of Ceremony. He was a gentle, unassuming
old man with a kindly face and the perfect
manners made by centuries of ceremonious
usage. He was assisted by many members of
the court, of whom Hata was the most important.</p>

<p class='c006'>The gardens were lovely beyond words to
the appreciative eyes of the visitors. They
seemed like fairyland. Each shrub, each tree,
each tiny plant grew in orderly, exquisite
beauty.</p>

<p class='c006'>David found Dulcie gazing out at a carved
and filigreed pavilion which seemed to have
drifted down softly upon the lake, where it
rested in a fringe of bright green water plants.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I couldn’t bear very much of this,” she
said soberly. “It is too beautiful. It won’t
let me be myself at all. I like to be good, but
I couldn’t keep on being as good as I am this
minute. I couldn’t stand it. You know, David,
the beautiful places at home shout at you,
like an organ or a big chorus. This whispers
and murmurs. You have to stop and listen
to it, and when you do that, it gets you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come over here and break the spell,”
laughed David. “They are serving American
ice cream in the gaudy silk tents beyond that
hedge.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The dinner that night was given by the city
of Tokio. Mr. Hammond promised to send
David back to the hotel for Dulcie when it
was over, so that she might see the dancing
in the Tea House of a Thousand Flowers.</p>

<p class='c006'>There was no formal placing at this dinner.
Many of the Japanese spoke English, and
David, to his great joy, found the youngest
reporter seated at his left, with the star reporter
just across the table. The tables were
placed around the walls of the large room,
with a space in the middle.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What’s all that floor space for?” asked the
youngest reporter, who was occasionally
known as Fred. “Do you suppose the Geishas
are going to dance here? It gums my works
if they are, because I simply gotter have that
Tea House of a Thousand Flowers for local
color. Gosh, isn’t this great?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“When you have been a correspondent as
long as I have,” the star reporter cut in, “you
won’t need local color. You will carry your
own paints. I could write up that Tea House
of a Thousand Flowers right now so you
could actually smell it. But they won’t have
the Geishas here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I heard they are going to give some heavy
stuff between courses,” said David. “Historical,
and all that. Hope they do. I want
to see something good. Why can’t they give
us a devil-dance, or something?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Cling to your lingerie,” advised the star.
“If I mistake not, you will see the real thing
tonight. Something to make the Geishas look
like a row of sparrows hunting crumbs on a
park bench.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The first course came on, and David fell to,
softly voicing the hope that he might be
spared to go home once more. At the close,
while the plates were changed, soft queer
music was played on strange instruments, the
like of which David had never seen.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Kind of throbbish, isn’t it?” he asked Fred.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hang on!” admonished the star, substituting
his own cigarette for one of Japanese
make.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the close of the second course, the plates
were changed quickly and the lights went
down to a dusky glow. The music changed.</p>

<p class='c006'>All at once two figures occupied the center
of the floor. They were men lithe and supple.
They were masked hideously. Their costumes
were indescribable. At once they plunged
into an orgy of action through which ran a
certain savage grace. They crept, leaped,
swayed, whirled, their gorgeous jeweled costumes
swinging and flashing. Then they were
gone, the lights flashed up.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That is the beginning of a most old and
antic dance,” remarked a Japanese on David’s
right. “You know, antic—that which has
come down from so old time. Regard—behold!
More is yet coming.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is it all about?” asked David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Old-time devils in Japan,” explained the
man.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thought so,” said David. “They sort of
look that way.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yess, that way,” agreed the Japanese.
“You watch!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The dance alternated with the dinner.
Changes of masks, different costumes, and
new dancers came and went in an exhibition
more exotic than David’s wildest dreams.</p>

<p class='c006'>At last it was over. The two chief dancers
fell, having carefully pretended to stab each
other with long thin swords, and were assisted
out by helpful hands. The dance and
the dinner were ended.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m all bogged down,” said the youngest
reporter. “I’ve a notion to go home and go
to bed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What, and miss seeing the Tea House of a
Thousand Flowers?” asked the star. “You
can’t do that. Come on, little one! Don’t let’s
forsake Captain Ellison.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m the quitter,” said David. “The chief
told me off to go and bring Miss Hammond
over to see the Geishas. I must beat it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When Dulcie came down in the elevator and
stepped into the bright light of the lobby,
David involuntarily exclaimed at her fresh
beauty.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good Lord, woman, what have you done
to yourself? You look as new as paint.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Some of it is paint, of course,” said Dulcie,
“but I’ve had a nap, and I’ve had good care.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m like to drop in my tracks,” said David,
“and your father—well, I caught him sneaking
a powder into his glass somewhere about
the middle of the nineteenth course.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bicarb—I hope it fixed him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If it didn’t, that dinner will,” groaned
David. “I’ll bet they had three chefs—Japanese,
American, and French—to fix that dinner.
The Japanese camouflage things so you
don’t know what you are eating. I thought I
was taking a dandy baked apple. It had red
cheeks, and a fresh stem sticking out with a
real apple leaf on it. And by George, it was
mashed potato! Everything like that.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I keep drawing dinner partners who can’t
speak English, and somebody’s French doesn’t
click, perhaps it is mine. They try me in
German, and some other funny lingoes; then
we all give up, and nod and wave our arms at
each other the rest of the meal. Believe me,
I’ve had my lesson. When I get home I am
going to learn to speak German and French
and Spanish, some Italian, a little Scandahoovian,
and enough Czechoslovakian to put
me across.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are going to be busy,” Dulcie said
grimly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, joking aside,” David continued, “an
aviator ought to be able to speak something
beside the good old mother tongue. It makes
me ashamed to grin and flap and contort my
face at these people who are doing everything
that can be done to make our visit pleasant,
and showering us with presents, beside. And
we can only thank them through an interpreter.
I’ve always suspected those guys. I’m
afraid they don’t transmit the fine shades of
my eloquence.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know,” said Dulcie. “I’d like to tell my
little maid how I appreciate everything she
does for me. It’s an awful nuisance that I
can’t. And tonight what a lot more fun it
would be if we could know what it is all
about.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Being a mere man,” said David, “I shall
get quite a kick merely out of seeing those
Geisha girls dance. Hello, here we are
already!”</p>

<p class='c006'>They had arrived at the most pretentious
and luxurious tea house in the city, the Tea
House of a Thousand Flowers. A couple of
Japanese aviators were watching for them,
and ushered them into the tea house, where
a native orchestra was tuning up. Most of
the passengers of the Moonbeam were present,
while the officers and crew had come as
one man. Dulcie and David joined Mr. Hammond
and his hosts, and immediately refreshments
were served.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Geisha girls trotted out on the floor.
They had honored their audience this night by
wearing their most elaborate and colorful
costumes. The music beat out a strange
dreamy tune. The tiny dancers with their
placid, bland little faces might well have been
animated flowers. Their shuffling short steps
gave the effect of gliding as they gyrated,
weaving and interweaving in a series of
rhythmic movements as old as time—movements
that had been premeditated and practiced
to the last turn.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What a kick the crew is getting out of all
this,” whispered David. “They will all go
home and talk darkly about having seen the
Geisha girls dancing and they will say, ‘Boy,
it was some dance, believe me!’ I wish you
could have seen the other dance at the dinner.
That was just plain fierce.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The music stopped and the little dancers
trotted out. Next came a troupe of Japanese
jugglers, who whirled gaily painted barrels,
gold chairs and small boys about their heads
with an abandon that made Dulcie gasp and
the crew of the Moonbeam roar with approval.
Next came a tight-rope act, which
included such difficult and daring feats that
the audience was spellbound.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Makes me feel as though I was at home at
Keith’s, only it’s a thousand times better than
Keith’s ever thought of being,” whispered
David.</p>

<p class='c006'>After the tight-rope walkers the Geishas
were to dance again, and then more juggling
and a sword dance, but Dulcie said, “I’ve seen
enough, David. I’m tired, after all. Can’t
we go?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Same here,” responded David. “It has
been a whirligig of a day. Ask your father if
we can’t be excused.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s all right,” Mr. Hammond agreed.
“I’ll explain to the Master of Ceremonies. Go
out as quietly as you can.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Prince Hata accompanied them to the car,
where Bill lounged at the wheel.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps a little drive under our Japanese
moon would make more happiness for you
after your strenuous day,” suggested the
Prince, as he said good-night.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That would be fine,” declared David. “Just
for a little while.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Prince spoke to Bill. As they drove
away, Dulcie said, “How nice and friendly
they are to each other! Not a bit haughty.
Did you notice what a friendly sort of understanding
smile Prince Hata gave Bill?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No; but they are all polite.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They never seem to scrap,” said Dulcie.
“It is beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Uh-uh! They never do seem to scrap but,
my child, these angel beings can fight like
demons. All this politeness, centuries old, has
made them value each other. That’s simply
psychological. They are utterly loyal to
Japan for what it is, what it has been, and
what it will be. However, they are struggling
against the terrible handicap of lack of
territory, and the only possible way for them
to get it is through conquest. The sea won’t
give it to them, and other nations naturally
won’t donate it. So if they want it, they have
got to fight for it. And as they are not afraid
to die, why, when they do fight, Miss Hammond,
they just wade right in.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, don’t let’s go under the crust, tonight.
I want my memories all as lovely as
this.” She leaned forward. “Where are you
taking us, Bill?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The young Japanese slowed down and
turned deferentially.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There iss a place in the Imperial grounds,
near the Emperor’s palace, that iss said to be
of the loveliest in Japan. It iss said that the
Emperor himself loves it. The windows of
hiss personal suite look upon it. The Emperor
sits long in those window, and dreams upon
it. They have many names for it; ‘Pearl of
Japan’ and ‘Window of Heaven’ and ‘Vision
of the Heart’.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, do take us there, Bill!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How will you get into the grounds?” asked
David. “I understand the palace gates are
locked and guarded at night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was most graciously given permission
that I should take you there. Usually only
princes of the blood are allowed to be admitted
at night.”</p>

<p class='c006'>At the gate of the Imperial grounds, two
sentries sprang from the shadow. Orders
had evidently been given them, however, for
they glanced at Bill and saluted.</p>

<p class='c006'>They rolled forward into the soft and perfumed
dusk of over-arching trees. Bill put
the dimmers on, and the big car made scarcely
a sound.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you know,” said David after a silence,
“I have a feeling that this is the greatest
concession they have made us; the greatest
compliment. To bring us into the Emperor’s
grounds at night, to see a view! Even if he
is away, everything belonging to the royal
family is guarded as though sacred. It’s
queer!”</p>

<p class='c006'>On and on they went, until a sudden turn
brought them to an arch made of flowering
trees, cut and woven and trained into a perfect
bow. They passed under it and on into
a denser shade, and suddenly beheld the vista
they had come to see. Bill stopped the car.</p>

<p class='c006'>In awed silence they regarded the serene
beauty of the view. Beyond the black shadow
of the trees, the water lay like sheets of dazzling
silver. At the water’s edge, grass and
flowers assumed new tints, shadows were
purple, and far in the distance the Sacred
Mountain seemed to float like an opalescent
bubble in the ether. Overhead hung the great
golden moon.</p>

<p class='c006'>At last Dulcie spoke in a whisper, “Thank
you, Bill!” And understanding, as always,
Bill turned the car and returned to the great
gate.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dulcie was silent all the way to the hotel.
When she stepped out, she turned impulsively
to Bill.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll never forget this evening, Bill. I wish
I could do something nice for you.” She unclasped
her bag, but there was a queer dignity
about Bill that forbade a tip. She snapped it
shut. “You speak English so well; if you
are ever in New York, find my father. I’d
perfectly love to have you for my chauffeur.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The young man’s eyes suddenly danced.
“It is that I thank you, Miss Hammond. I’ll
not forget,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dulcie did not waken the following morning
in time to see her father. Indeed she was
just dressed when word was brought up that
the car was waiting to take her to see the
princess. It was late when she returned, and
she ordered dinner in her own room, and went
early to bed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond and David did not return to
the Imperial Hotel until a very late hour.
Stopping at the desk on the way to his room,
Mr. Hammond found that the whole party
had been the guests of the hotel for the entire
time of their visit.</p>

<p class='c006'>Early transportation had been arranged to
take them to the port at Kasumigaura in the
morning so, writing a word to Dulcie warning
her to be on time, Mr. Hammond smoked
a last cigar and tumbled into bed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c007'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br />AN EAVESDROPPER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The Moonbeam was to take off from Kasumigaura
at half-past seven on Sunday morning.
Mr. Hammond had reached the airport
at a very early hour but it was not until
seven-fifteen that he saw in the distance a
group of cars bringing the last laggard passengers,
among them Dulcie and her elderly
escorts, Doctors Trigg and Sims.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond gave a sigh of relief, and
went at once into the directors’ room where
their Excellencies, the Japanese Ministers of
State and War, awaited him. There were the
last compliments to be paid, the last papers to
be signed, the last farewells to be spoken, and
at twenty minutes of eight the Moonbeam
took flight.</p>

<p class='c006'>As on her arrival, she circled the city of
Tokio, returned to salute the port of
Kasumigaura, and sailed out over the Pacific
Ocean on the last leg of her journey around
the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>At nine o’clock Mr. Hammond, watching
the endless expanse of glistening water from
the windows of the control room, suddenly
remembered something.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, I haven’t had my breakfast,” he said
to David. “Clean forgot it!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You had better have some coffee, hadn’t
you, sir? I could do with a cup myself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Giving the wheel to Van Arden, the two
started for the salon. At the door Mr. Hammond
stopped.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What the—what’s this?” he demanded,
looking suspiciously at Dulcie. In the middle
of the room stood a large chest made of exquisite
wood-inlay, delicately colored. It was
evidently an antique, rare as well as beautiful.
“Dulcie, I told you we didn’t want to take any
more weight on board.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s not more weight. That’s Mr.
Hamilton,” Dulcie explained sweetly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mr. Hamilton! Now what do you mean,
Dulcie?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, daddy, Prince Hata made me a present
of that chest, and I really didn’t forget
what you said about weight. But I found I
could lift one end of the chest quite easily,
and you know I couldn’t lift an end of Mr.
Hamilton. So I thought to myself, ‘There!
Mr. Hamilton has left the ship, and my chest
can go in his place.’ I think it was rather
clever of me, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond groaned.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And,” Dulcie went on, “I was dying to tell
Doctor Trigg and Doctor Sims and David
about my visit to the palace, but I wouldn’t
until you were here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Amazing abnegation,” said Doctor Sims.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, if abnegation means being perfectly
crazy to tell, and waiting patiently for hours
and hours till my own father can hear it first,
why, that’s it,” said Dulcie. “Go on and eat,
you two, and I’ll tell about it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The two princesses came for me. Dad, you
should have seen them. Paris frocks, tricky
hats, wonderful shoes. Absolutely the latest
things in sport clothes. They both speak perfect
English, even up-to-date slang. And they
said, ‘What a dear you are to come! We have
been dying to meet you, but we have been
down at the summer palace, and only got
home late last night!’ And it seems they are
ladies-in-waiting to the Empress and had to
get permission to leave for a few hours.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When we reached the palace, they said to
come up to their rooms while they dressed,
and I could tell them all about dear old Vassar,
and how awful it was about the last Army and
Navy game. We went through an Aladdin’s
palace to reach their rooms, where a couple of
maids appeared by magic, and the girls simply
dashed out of their frocks and were put into
layers of Japanese robes, crusted stiff with
gold embroidery. It seems the princess, their
mother, does not allow them to wear foreign
dress in the home. She is old-school. I asked
what about me, but they said I was all right.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The last big sash was just tied on when
the princess sent for us, and we went down
to the audience room. I was scared to death.
I followed them into the room, and there was
the princess sitting in a carved chair on a
little platform, with a group of attendants behind
her. The girls went up and bowed very
low, and spoke to their mother in sweet-sounding
Japanese. The old princess held up
her tiny little old hand in a gesture of greeting,
and I made a deep, deep curtsey, nearly
to the floor. When I looked up she was smiling
at me, and her little face looked so kind
and plain under its jeweled headdress that I
curtsied again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She said something to the princesses that
they didn’t translate, but they told me later
that she was very much pleased with me.
Wasn’t that lucky? I did so want to be a
credit to you!</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then we stood and talked, and sipped tea,
and the princess asked me questions which
the girls translated. She sent all sorts of
felicitations to you on your flight. Presently
she gave a signal, and I said good-bye, and
sort of backed out, leaving her there in the
middle of that enormous room full of wonders,
looking for all the world like an old ivory
figurine.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We went into a queer, sweet room where
Prince Hata was waiting for us, and luncheon
was served—a real Japanese meal with a few
American extras for me. When the Prince
had to go back to you, we went back to the
girls’ rooms, and talked college, and all that.
I know a number of the girls they know at
home, but I guess I am the only one who
knows how very important they are over here.
They are both coming to visit me next
winter.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good-night!” exclaimed David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They are just regular girls,” said Dulcie.
“Of course, being princesses has its drawbacks,
but they have had lots of good times,
even so.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, while we were talking a couple of
men-servants came in with this chest. It was
for me, from Prince Hata. The girls evidently
expected it, for they hopped up and
clapped their hands, and in came a couple of
maids carrying a whole outfit of Japanese
ceremonial robes. Everything a princess
would wear at court.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then the older princess brought a square
box, and said, ‘This is from mother,’ and there
was a jeweled headdress.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They had me take off my dress, and the
two maids dressed me up in everything.
Daddy, I looked too grand! I’m going to give
a Japanese party just as soon as we get back.
And we’d better put in a Japanese garden for
it. You can radio that big landscape man.
He’ll know how to make one.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond sighed. “The parent pays,”
he paraphrased sadly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dulcie ignored that.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When you see everything, you won’t blame
me for bringing it along.” She opened the
chest, which smelled pungently of mysterious
perfumes, and one by one lifted out the priceless
garments and the wonderful headdress.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Museum pieces, every one,” declared Doctor
Trigg.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know what to say to all this,” said
Mr. Hammond.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is nothing you can say,” said Dulcie.
“I had a hard time saying anything, myself.
I was simply flabbergasted.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How did you get it out here?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, that nice Bill had a friend drive it out
in a Ford truck. Bill is a nice boy. He gave
me a package, too, when I shook hands good-bye.
Think of that! I told him, by the way,
dad, that if he ever wanted to chauffeur in
America, he could drive for me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Har!” said Doctor Sims twice.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here is the package. Let’s open it.” She
undid the soft paper, and found an inner
wrapping of silk around a quaint box of hand
wrought silver. Opening it, she gave a little
cry of delight.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Bill shouldn’t have done this!” she
cried, holding up a jewel. It was a heart made
of a close-set line of red stones. Within the
heart, on a fragile bit of chain, hung a large
pear-shaped pearl.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Look at it!” whispered Dulcie.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, well,” said Doctor Trigg, taking the
exquisite thing in his hand. “Fortunately I
can explain this to you, Dulcie. In my studies
of the Orient, its peoples and customs, I distinctly
remember a description of this very
jewel. It is a gift designed especially for
young girls just budding into womanhood.
This heart typifies the heart of woman. Red
blood (the sacred rubies) trace its outline.
Within hangs this pearl, the tear which is
within every heart. But it cannot escape
while the sacred rubies imprison it. A lovely
thought.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Another museum piece,” said Doctor Sims.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bill shouldn’t have done it,” repeated Dulcie,
in an absolutely stricken tone. “How will
he ever pay for it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t worry,” said Doctor Trigg. “He
won’t feel it. You see, Dulcie, his position as
chauffeur was rather a lark. It was only for
the duration of our visit. Bill’s name is really
Prince Kayoto. He is Hata’s cousin.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, oh!” cried Dulcie. “Why didn’t you
tell me?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He didn’t wish it. Besides, it was really
immaterial. You treated him like a prince.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I offered him a job—a good job as
chauffeur!” She laughed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It will give you both something to laugh
over when you come to Princeton next winter
to visit Trigg and me,” said Doctor Sims so
unexpectedly that Mr. Hammond stared.
“Kayoto is enrolled as a student.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Dulcie folded the garments and put away
her treasures in the beautiful chest.</p>

<p class='c006'>The remainder of the day was very quiet
on board the Moonbeam. Everyone was exhausted
from their strenuous days in Japan,
and welcomed a rest. It was only about eight
o’clock that evening when Dulcie said, “I am
going to leave you three boys,” and smiled at
her father and Doctors Trigg and Sims.
“Good-night, daddy.” She pulled him down
and kissed him. “You, too,” she added, walking
over to the two doctors. “You are both so
sweet to me.” She dropped light kisses on
the professors’ withered cheeks, and went
away.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A nice child—a sweet child,” said Doctor
Trigg, softly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Doctor Sims touched his cheek with a careful
finger. Finally he said,—</p>

<p class='c006'>“Trigg, I am beginning to wonder if a lifetime
spent in the unbroken dissemination of
knowledge, exclusively to men’s classes, does
not occasionally leave something, a subtle intangible
something, to be desired.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Doctor Trigg looked at his friend. “Poor
old Sims,” he said; then as an afterthought,
“Poor old me!”</p>

<p class='c006'>By the following morning the Moonbeam
had made more than her usual mileage. She
seemed destined to escape the stormy, unsettled
winds that had kept the Graf Zeppelin
dodging while on the same lap of the journey.
Far ahead, ominous masses of black clouds
would pile up, only to melt away as they approached.
On either side they watched sudden
storms rise, struggle and disappear. It
was as though they were moving in a charmed
area, where there were no adverse currents
and the steady tail-wind persisted. The hours
passed uneventfully enough to please even as
exacting a pilot as David.</p>

<p class='c006'>Radiograms flew back and forth from
Friedrichshafen, Tokio, Los Angeles, San
Francisco and New York, while from numbers
of American cities came messages asking
the Moonbeam to divert her course sufficiently
to pay them an aerial call.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond found it hard to refuse these
requests. He was so proud of the Moonbeam
that he wanted the whole country to see their
American dirigible. He kept a list of the
radiograms, and determined to make a later
trip which would embrace all the larger cities
of the United States. He was bombarded
with requests by radio from eager, highly
efficient publicity men, taking time by the
forelock, and offering every known inducement
for a word of commendation from him
for products ranging from cigarettes to
breakfast bacon. Far away as they still were,
they commenced to feel the stir and restlessness
that is America.</p>

<p class='c006'>High spirits prevailed, and an ever-increasing
sense of friendliness. A pool was
made on the day’s mileage, and wagers as to
the exact hour and minute of sighting land.
Late in the afternoon the youngest reporter
exclaimed, “Say, d’you know that it’s tomorrow
that we gain a day? We go to bed
Monday night and wake up Monday morning.
Gee, isn’t that funny?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Har, no!” said Doctor Sims. “What’s a
day lost or gained in the immensity of time?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Time has no immensity, except in perspective,”
said Doctor Trigg. “An extra day
may be of paramount importance to our
young friend.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He himself is merely an infinitesimal
atom,” said Doctor Sims, regarding the
youngest reporter critically. “So are you; so
am I.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Undoubtedly. But as an atom, I confess
that I regard the gaining of a day with a certain
thrill. One day, Nicholas! A day which
may change the course of empire, breed great
men, give some needed discovery to the world,
write a deathless song, or see a noble deed
done.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Or some great wrong,” added Doctor Sims.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If so, Nicholas, be sure that Time will
right it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It will mean an extra eight-eighty on my
pay check, anyhow,” said the youngest reporter.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Didn’t I tell you, Nicholas?” asked Doctor
Trigg.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You tell me so much!” exploded Doctor
Sims wrathfully.</p>

<p class='c006'>When everyone woke up to their second
Monday, there was a feeling that something
out of the ordinary ought to happen to celebrate
it. But the extra day went serenely on
its way, with what Doctor Sims called “an
ostentatious lack of incident.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Whenever they were at liberty David and
Red pored over the plans of David’s invention,
and talked about it with technical abandon.
David did not undervalue Red’s help, and it
depressed his just and generous heart to think
that they could not benefit together on the
invention, but to secure the patent, manufacture
and put it on the market would take more
thousands of dollars than both boys would
possess in the next twenty years.</p>

<p class='c006'>David was faced by the conditions that discourage
effort in so many young inventors.
Usually their sessions were broken up by
Red’s furious demand of fate to know why
the barren farm in Oklahoma, only twenty
miles from Wally’s gushers, remained stubbornly
dry. Twice had the Ryans, pooling
their meager resources, drilled down, never
even reaching sand.</p>

<p class='c006'>David did not wish to mention his invention
to Mr. Hammond until he had put it up for
the prize at the Goodlow School. He did not
know that Dulcie had spoken to her father
about it. However, Mr. Hammond respected
his reticence, and asked no questions.</p>

<p class='c006'>Late on that queer second Monday, Red met
Dulcie in the control room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I hear you have bespoken a new chauffeur,
Miss Hammond,” he said quizzically. “I
wonder you didn’t offer me the job.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I couldn’t,” said Dulcie. “I knew all the
time that you are a prince.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is it so?” said Red, his blue eyes dancing.
“Well, ’twould have been a pity not to have
been recognized by a lady in one’s own rank.
And,” he added, “don’t think it strange that
I have not lavished gifts on you like those
others. Truth is, I’m havin’ some stars taken
down, very careful, with some chunks of
that Japanese moon, and set for your wearin’,
in bracelets of platinum dug in the Urals. All
of which takes time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>David and Van Arden joined in the laugh.
Red sauntered away, but an hour later he was
back, a troubled look on his face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There’s no use trying to make better time,”
he said gloomily. “Those engineers are doing
their best, and so are the engines, but they
have their limitations. Gosh, how I hate to
disappoint the Big Fella!”</p>

<p class='c006'>They sauntered back to David’s stateroom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wish I had my accelerators. They are so
simple that we might have had a set made in
Tokio. I bet they would have speeded us up
ten miles an hour.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wish the plans were in a safe,” said Red
uneasily. “Where are they now?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“In that suitcase.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“In that suitcase!” repeated Red loudly.
“My Lord, anybody could lift ’em! And
you’ve nothing on earth but my word to prove
they are yours! It has taken two years to
perfect them, and before you could reconstruct
them, the other fellow could get the
prize, or market them somehow. You are
crazy to leave them there.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t be such an old woman, Red! No
one knows about them, and if they did, no one
on this ship would take them. However, I
wish we had a set installed. As the engines
are now, we simply can’t make better speed.
But with that friction removed and all the rest
of it, there ought to be a great difference.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” said Red, “something has got to be
done, and darned quick, or we’ll be toddling
into Lakehurst on Zeppelin time, or more.
And we’d get the merry ha-ha all around.
Anyhow, you put those papers under lock and
key.”</p>

<p class='c006'>David laughed, and followed Red forward
to the chart room, where the indicator stood
stubbornly at seventy miles.</p>

<p class='c006'>But they did not know that at the moment
when they had stepped from David’s cabin
into the passage, a man had slipped like a
shadow into another room; a man, who, just
outside David’s open door, had listened to the
conversation between the two friends.</p>

<p class='c006'>The listener stood deep in thought.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In the suitcase, eh?” he whispered. “Well,
there’s no hurry.”</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c006'>But that night Red woke suddenly. David,
a flashlight in his hand, was shaking him. He
was very pale.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wake up, Red!” he said. “The plans are
gone!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c007'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br />ON THE OBSERVER’S PLATFORM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Red lunged up, awake in an instant.
“What’s that?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The plans are gone; you were right.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Red, swearing softly and fervently, commenced
to throw on his clothes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No use cussing,” said David. “We’ve got
to think what to do. I just left the wheel, and
what you said kind of worried me, so I
thought I’d hide ’em. I opened the case, and
they were gone.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did you look around?” asked Red.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course; but they are not in the cabin.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What’s the time?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Three.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Trouble came scrambling up, curled around
in Red’s lap, and commenced to purr. Automatically
Red scratched the small ear.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gone!” he repeated. “Well, they have got
to be somewhere. Just one thing to do, Dave.
Go to Mr. Hammond the minute he’s up, and
tell him the whole thing. It’s a dirty scandal,
of course, but those plans must be found.
Let’s go down.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Easy does it,” warned David. “Don’t
want to wake anybody.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Silently, thoroughly, they searched every
inch of David’s room. The plans were not
there. They could not sleep, so they sat in the
salon and smoked. There Mr. Hammond
found them when, as usual, he came out at
dawn. Briefly they told him what had
happened.</p>

<p class='c006'>“By George,” he said, “that’s a rotten
shame! Who on earth would do it? Whom
do you suspect?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, sir,” said Red grimly, “my brother
always says, ‘Don’t ever lose time suspectin’
anybody. Look for a motive’.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“There’s a good deal in that, but I confess I
don’t see any motives just now. Wonder if
there is any coffee left over. This has upset
me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll make some, sir, if you can keep the
cook from stabbin’ me later,” said Red, and
he went into the spotless galley.</p>

<p class='c006'>While Red made coffee, David explained
something of the nature of the device
minutely described in the stolen plans, what
he had hoped it would mean to dirigible navigation,
and his high hopes of winning the
Goodlow School prize with it. When Red returned
with the steaming percolator Mr.
Hammond tested the brew with evident
satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perfect,” he said. “Now I can think. We
have been talking this invention over, Red.
Why, it is a great thing! Just what we have
been groping for. If it is a success, it is immensely
valuable. The papers must be
found.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“They must,” said Red, “for it will work.
I know it!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wouldn’t have had such a thing happen
for anything,” mused Mr. Hammond. “With
the ship full of newspaper correspondents
lapping everything up for copy! But we can’t
side-step. We will have a meeting right after
breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c006'>To avoid crowding the salon, Mr. Hammond
divided the meeting. The passengers, officers,
and three engineers met first. Mr. Hammond
laid the case before them, and each man was
searched. Afterward the crew and the rest
of the engineers gathered. There was a general
demand, led by Wally, for a search of
everybody’s personal belongings. Committees
were formed, every garment was examined,
every cushion probed, hangings taken
down, books and magazines gone over leaf by
leaf.</p>

<p class='c006'>The crew’s quarters were searched. Men
in their soft overalls and felt shoes swarmed
over the catwalks in the vast hull and looked
in every conceivable place where a packet of
papers might have been hidden. A cloud
rested on the Moonbeam. Everyone was
anxious and angry.</p>

<p class='c006'>The case seemed more flagrant on account
of David’s popularity. Not a man of the ship,
officers, passengers or crew, who was not
wholly devoted to the young captain. Everyone
rejoiced in his success. The manner in
which he had piloted the ship through storm
and calm aroused in them an unselfish pride.
They were back of him, ready to do anything.
Yet here someone had stolen from him something
more than money. They had stolen his
hopes and his ambitions.</p>

<p class='c006'>David had spent every leisure hour for
months on his invention. There was a time
limit on the entrants for the contest. All
papers must be in the hands of the judges no
later than the fifteenth of July, ten days after
they were scheduled to reach Lakehurst. The
plans could not be reconstructed in ten weeks.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the morning Doctor Sims and David
met in the passageway.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, young man, whom are you suspecting?”
demanded the professor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No one,” replied David. “I’ve been advised
to look for a motive.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Correct; but there might be several motives.
Jealousy, vanity, the desire for money
or fame, revenge—a wide choice.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Envy, hatred, and malice all point just one
way with me,” said Red, when David repeated
the professor’s words to him, “but it can’t be.
Wally wouldn’t dare do such a thing.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, Lord, there you go on Wally again!
What in thunder would he do such a crazy
fool thing for? Why, he even owns shares in
the Moonbeam.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yeah?” sneered Red. “And what’s it got
him, the poor devil? Write-ups and interviews
perhaps, but underneath is the sting of
being cooped up with a bunch of people that
can’t abide the sight of him. Can’t you see,
you blind bat, that he’s never on the in with
them? Not on the poker, or pools, or their
jokes, unless he butts in. And he feels it.
You come along, and it’s ‘Hi, captain, join us,’
and ‘Come over with us and sit down, captain,’
and so on. I swear, sometimes I am sorry for
him, even if his grandfather did swap farms
with my grandfather.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Look at my hand,” said David absently.
A broad purple stain spread across the palm.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How did you get that?” asked Red.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s indelible lead. I must have spilled
some leads out of my suitcase when I was
turning over things to find that envelope. I
was on my hands and knees, and must have
pressed my hand down pretty hard. My palm
was moist, and the darned thing spread the
way it always does. Beastly stuff! It won’t
wash off.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mechanic’s paste ought to fix it,” said Red.
“Where is the pencil?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Clipped to my lost notebook. ‘Anyone returning
plans may keep pencil, and no questions
asked’,” David said ruefully.</p>

<p class='c006'>Things went badly all that day. The ship
lagged along in a head wind, all five engines
going at top speed, every engineer at his post.
It was generally known, now, that David had
no copy of the lost plans. So the thief could
make the invention public under the name of
an accomplice.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond stayed in the chart room,
watching the indicator as it ruthlessly registered
the speed of the ship, the conviction
growing steadily that they would never be
able to beat the record of their great predecessor,
the Graf Zeppelin.</p>

<p class='c006'>David hovered over the wheel. He was sick
at heart. Little things bothered him. The
blue stain on the palm of his hand annoyed
him. The mechanic’s paste had not worked
very well.</p>

<p class='c006'>After luncheon Mr. Hammond instituted
another search for the missing plans, but in
vain. Just one more night, and they would
reach Los Angeles, and the plans would walk
off for good. Mr. Hammond decided to
search every man before he left the ship.</p>

<p class='c006'>When afternoon tea was served, Dulcie
coaxed David from the control room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You haven’t spoken to me for days,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m rather upset, Dulcie,” he replied, “and
pretty poor company.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are always good company, Davie,”
she said, comfortingly. “Some good hot tea
will pep you up. Cakes?”</p>

<p class='c006'>David sipped his tea in silence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wish you wouldn’t worry,” Dulcie said
presently. “Dad thinks he can advertise it so
the thief won’t dare to use your plans at all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“That won’t work, Dulcie. You see, every
scratch I had ever made on the subject was in
that envelope, and it would only be my word
against his.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Couldn’t Red swear he had seen it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, and then some pals of the thief could
swear that they had actually helped construct
it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dad’s going to search every man as he
gets off the ship at Los Angeles.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What’s to keep him from weighting it, and
tossing it out of the ship some good place outside
the city? He could easily go back for it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“My word, David, what an awful thought!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think the plans are gone for good, Dulcie,
but if they are, I’m not going to crab over it.
My luck holds yet. Nothing can ever take
away from me the fact that I have been captain
of the Moonbeam. I have learned a lot,
and I have made some good friends.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I come in there, Davie,” said Dulcie decidedly.</p>

<p class='c006'>David flushed, then looked at her squarely.
“You are the best of all, Dulcie. The best
little pal; the truest, squarest kid. All I hope
is that you won’t forget me when we get back
to Ayre.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t you worry,” Dulcie said grimly.
“You can’t escape, poor dear! I’m a big,
rough woman, Davie. Didn’t you see daddy,
all six-feet-three of him, trying to sneak off
in the Moonbeam without me? What happened,
I ask you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>David laughed. “Gosh, you would have
scared anyone.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, then, have another cup of tea, to
celebrate.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As he reached for the cup, Dulcie pointed
to his palm. “What’s that blue smudge?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Off an indelible pencil,” David answered
carelessly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, won’t it come off? Wally has one on
his hand, too. He asked me what would take
it off.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mechanic’s paste takes some of it off,”
David replied.</p>

<p class='c006'>Presently David went back to his cabin and
lay down on the bunk. He had spent a sleepless
night, and the day had been a hard and
depressing one. He half dozed, but his subconscious
mind worked busily on, and presently
he seemed to hear Dulcie speak.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wally has one on his hand, too.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Wally! David lifted his hand and looked at
the aniline stain spreading across the palm;
the stain where he had rested his hand on the
broken bit of indelible lead. There had been
a splash of water on the floor. It must have
softened the lead. Indelible pencils were
always like that. Wally had a stain on his
hand, too, did he?</p>

<p class='c006'>David got up and, squaring his muscular
shoulders, buttoned his coat. The action was
automatic—the gesture of a man buckling on
armor. He went to the control room, gave a
brief order, then went swiftly to Cram’s door,
knocked, and turned the knob. Wally was
reading.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Cram, you have never been up on the observer’s
platform, have you?” David asked
smoothly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, hello, Ellison,” said Wally. “No, I’ve
never been up in flight. I went up there back
in Ayre before the Moonbeam was finished.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s a great sight over the ocean, especially
now, at sunset. Come along, won’t you? I’m
going up for a minute. There’s just time before
dinner.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Wally hesitated, then rose with evident
reluctance. “All right,” he said. “I suppose
I ought to be able to say I’d been up there in
flight, but it’s the last thing I’ll care for, I bet.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He followed David into the hull, through
devious ways up ladders and along narrow
catwalks.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This doesn’t appeal to me,” he growled
when at last he crawled through the trap and
emerged on the small platform on the dizzy
top of the ship. The platform was surrounded
by a strong wire railing, but it looked unstable
to Wally, who tested it with his hand as David
followed through the trap.</p>

<p class='c006'>This platform is seldom used, except in war
time. David stepped up and, slamming down
the trap door, stood upon it and faced Wally.
The last exotic colors of the Pacific sunset
reddened the illimitable space in which they
seemed to swing along—the two men cut off
from all else living. David was silent.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I don’t like it,” Wally admitted after
a moment. “Too darned much sky! You
get a roll up here that you don’t feel in the
ship, too. And it’s cold. Why isn’t this railing
higher? It isn’t safe; just comes to my waist.
So if you’ll just step off that trap, Ellison,
we’ll go down.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not yet, Cram.” David spoke quite gently.
“I don’t want you to miss any of this. We are
riding high—higher every minute. I ordered
the ship sent up a mile or so, and we are climbing
fast.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Imagine,” he went on, “how easy it would
be for a good husky chap, like me, for instance,
to heave another chap over. He’d go
bouncing down the side of the ship, clutching,
but finding nothing to grab. Then—well, that
would be about all. I wonder how long you
would have to think, to remember, before you
lost consciousness.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Lord, what a morbid mind! You want to
watch out for yourself,” said Wally with a
forced laugh. The sunset shone full on his
face. He was chalk white. A sickly fear was
spreading through him. “Come on, Ellison,
let’s go down. Thanks for the view. I’ve had
enough of it. Come on.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No hurry,” said David. He stood against
the sunset. That or the fact that there was
nothing to measure him by, no familiar scale
of size, made his big muscular figure look
gigantic to Wally’s horrified gaze. For Wally
was suddenly tasting a terror past his comprehension.
The man was mad. Ellison was
mad—mad—mad—mad. The words filled his
brain like the beat of a drum.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come on, Davie, old chap, let’s go down,”
he coaxed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No!” thundered David. He took a single
step toward Wally across the little platform.
With one hand he caught him by the lapels of
his coat, and shook him gently.</p>

<p class='c006'>Wally screamed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Stop that!” said David. He took up
Wally’s right hand and looked at it. He
nodded at the purple stain he saw there.
“Where is it?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where’s what?” chattered Wally.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You know. The envelope—my plans.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How do I know?” cried Wally shrilly.
“You think I took them? Well, I didn’t. What
would I want with your plans? Let go of
me!” He pushed at David’s hand. It was a
grip of steel. “Let go, I tell you! I want to go
down!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No,” said David. “Where is the envelope,
Cram? You know.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t know anything about it, you fool!”
cried Cram. “I’ll fix you for this! Open that
trap!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where is the envelope with my papers? If
I have to ask you that again, I’ll fight you,
Cram, right up here—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You mean you’ll murder me!” Cram suddenly
screamed. “Help! help!” His voice,
thin and shattered, was torn to tatters by the
wind and drifted into space. He suddenly
slumped at David’s feet, writhing.</p>

<p class='c006'>Strangely, David’s anger turned to pity. He
pulled the cringing object upright. “Come,
Cram,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll tell, I’ll tell!” Cram screamed. “Let
me down! The envelope is stuck under the
bottom of the love birds’ cage,” he was panting.
“In Trigg’s room. I took it! Go look!
It’s there!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is this the truth?” demanded David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I swear it,” groaned Cram. “God’s own
truth!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You will have to pay for this, Cram,” said
David, tightening his grasp on Cram’s arm.
“You will do just what I say. If you don’t, I
shall make you wish that you were dead.”
Anger rose in him again. “You poor thieving
cur, you! I ought to—”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, don’t, David, don’t! I can’t stand any
more! I’ll do anything you say, only take me
down from this place.”</p>

<p class='c006'>David stooped, opened the trap, and still
keeping a hand on his shoulder, shoved Wally
down the ladder, along the catwalk, down the
rear ladder into the passage that led into the
cabins and the salon. The sound of voices
came to them. Everyone was at dinner.</p>

<p class='c006'>David pushed his prisoner into Doctor
Trigg’s room. The awakened love birds
scolded softly as Cram felt under the floor of
the cage. It stood on the table on four short
brass legs. He fumbled a moment, then
thrust something into David’s hand. It was
the missing envelope. David glanced inside.
The papers were undisturbed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come on,” he said grimly.</p>

<p class='c006'>He shoved Cram before him into the salon,
and stopped. Everyone looked up. There was
a silence. He held up the envelope, and at the
same time pushed Cram forward.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This man has something to say to you,” he
said.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c007'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br />MORE SPEED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Cowering beside David, he got out the
miserable confession at last. Bare facts that
clothed themselves with sordid details in the
minds of the listeners. Not a man spoke.
Not a man could look at him. Searching each
face, Walter Cram saw only the reflection of
his own disgrace. He turned and bolted to
the sanctuary of his cabin.</p>

<p class='c006'>David, the precious envelope in his hand,
turned to go; but in a moment the passengers
surrounded him, shaking his hand, patting
him on the back, congratulating him wholeheartedly.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the last to reach David was the
youngest reporter. “Gosh, we are glad, captain!
It sure was a rotten deal for you, and
not so nice for the rest of us. Say, it is going
to make a swell story!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Round up the other press men, will you,
please?” David asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>When they came, he said, “Boys, I know you
will give me a square deal. I am going to ask
a big favor of you. I don’t want you to write
a word about what has just happened. Not
a single word.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Aw, have a heart, captain! It’s too good
to kill,” cried the star reporter.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But you are going to kill it just the same,”
said David, smiling at the speaker. “I think
you fellows are all good friends of mine. I
think you will kill the story for my sake. And
if you won’t, why, please kill it for the sake of
the Moonbeam. It’s her maiden flight, you
know, and it would be a crime to smear her
all up with such a dirty scandal.”</p>

<p class='c006'>One of the men laughed. “Hear him!
You’d think the ship was a girl. Well, Captain
Ellison, it’s all right as far as I go. I’ll
respect the unblemished reputation of your
husky lady-love. How about it, boys?”</p>

<p class='c006'>There was some grumbling, but finally
David won their promise. The affair of the
stolen plans would never get into print.</p>

<p class='c006'>Cram did not appear nor would he eat, sending
back untouched the tray the chef sent in.
About ten o’clock Mr. Hammond went to
Cram’s room. It was two hours before he
came out and called David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, David, I guess this unfortunate affair
is nearly finished. I wish I could forget
it. I made Cram talk to me. He acknowledged
that he had it in for you, but his reasons
were so vague that I couldn’t make anything
out of them. However, it’s done. I am sorry
for him, but he’s got to be wiped off our
slate. So I’ve bought him out; taken over his
shares in the Moonbeam. I gave him a check,
and made him sign receipts for everything.
He is going to leave us at Los Angeles.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank Heaven for that!” said David devoutly.
“I simply can’t bear to see him. I
want a chance to forget, too.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The remainder of that night was stormy,
and David made it an excuse for remaining at
the wheel or around the control room most of
the time. With the first glimpse of the California
coast line the next morning, as they came
down toward San Francisco, the weather
changed into a sparkle and dazzle of sunshine
and balmy breezes. They were flying low past
the city, its hundreds of slips and piers
stretching out into the bay like a fringe. The
usual civic greeting met them. Flags broke
out, whistles tooted, sirens moaned, and
bells rang. Numbers of planes buzzed about
them like flies, their engines roaring out the
general spirit of welcome.</p>

<p class='c006'>David sent for Red.</p>

<p class='c006'>“After we have landed at Los Angeles, I
want you to go with me to see if we can’t get
the accelerators made up. I know they can be
done, but we may have to oversee the job
pretty closely.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sure, we will do that. It won’t take long.
There is nothing that would require a mould
or special machinery.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If we get them made,” said David, “we will
adjust them to the engines without telling
anyone but the engineers. There can be no
harm in trying them. We are only two hours
ahead of the time of the G. Z., and a run of
bad weather would make us lose every bit of
that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We won’t lose that, if we have to get out
and push,” declared Red.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Los Angeles opened her arms to them
at twelve-twenty, noon, many things happened.
The first one off the ship was Walter
Cram. He swung himself down almost before
the steps were adjusted and, like a shadow,
slipped into the cheering crowd. Only Dulcie
saw him go. From her window she watched
the slim figure hurrying away like a fugitive.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good-bye, Wally,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was his only farewell.</p>

<p class='c006'>As soon as official greetings had been extended
to Commander Hammond and the officers,
David and Red taxied into the city, the
precious plans in David’s pocket.</p>

<p class='c006'>Red unfolded a telegraph blank.</p>

<p class='c006'>“See what they handed me back there. It’s
a night letter from the Padre. Whatever do
you suppose he is up to? He says, ‘Am meeting
you at landing field Lakehurst stop most
important business stop arrange to spend a
day with me stop mother is fine.’ Thank God
he added that! I’d have thought he had bad
news. Here’s what I’ll answer. ‘Can’t promise
as present plan is to take ship back to Ayre
immediately. Radio nature of important
business.’ That ought to get something out
of him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Red sent his message from the first Western
Union office they passed. Then in the delightful
excitement of machine shops that
smelled of oil and steel he forgot all about it.</p>

<p class='c006'>At one-thirty the officers and passengers
were hurried off to a civic luncheon, and
thence to a meeting of the Pioneer Daughters
of California. But David side-stepped the
Daughters, and dashed off to see how the accelerators
were coming along under the eagle
eye of Red Ryan.</p>

<p class='c006'>He had only time to give a few words of advice,
then rushed away to a reception at the
Aviation Club. He begged off from the Board
of Commerce meeting which came next, and
went to the machine shop again. Red had not
left since the work started, and David made
him go out for a sandwich. At five the shop
closed, and David and Red drove back to their
hotel, where they put the envelope in the safe.</p>

<p class='c006'>David dressed for the dinner given by the
mayor and council. Four hundred sat down;
and for the honor guests, the favors were
fountain pens, with cases of California gold.
Later they had boxes at a popular show. Still
later, when David finally reached his room, he
found Red sprawled out in a big chair.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My dog, boy, do you know what time it
is?” demanded David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That and more,” said Red, yawning. “I
just got in. What’s on for tomorrow?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing much but the accelerators. I
simply can’t trail around with Mr. Hammond
all day tomorrow. Here’s a list of activities:
The poor man is going to speak before the
Board of Trade, the Elks, the Rotary Club,
the K. of C., Kiwanis, Masons, and the United
Churches of Los Angeles. Also there is a
luncheon given by the Sons of the Forty-niners,
and a dinner.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“All I can say is, Miss Dulcie is headed
toward an orphans’ home. The Big Fella
can’t stand it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Neither can we, if we don’t sleep. Go to
bed, you loafer, if you want to go to the machine
shop with me at eight o’clock, sharp!”</p>

<p class='c006'>On Thursday morning, local committees
discovered that the eminent professors, Doctors
Trigg and Sims, had by some dastardly
stroke of fate never seen Los Angeles! As
soon as Dulcie appeared, they were all three
bundled into a big limousine, with an enthusiastic
native Californian whom Doctor Sims
caustically referred to afterwards as “our
barker”.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond worked his way grimly
through speeches and interviews, and the
others accomplished great feats of sightseeing.
But at last the day ended and as soon as
they could escape from their hosts, they retired.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Mr. Hammond, after a restless night,
reached the hangar Friday morning, he found
David and Red there before him, looking
fresh and crisp. Both were in overalls.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond frankly acknowledged to the
boys his disappointment in the performance
of the ship during the trip over Siberia and
the Pacific. “I was sure we’d pick up speed,
but those head winds have made us lose our
chance to make the record I wanted,” he said
gloomily. “She just can’t do it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We could gain a little by setting a straight
course, instead of flying over so many cities,”
David suggested.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s not good policy,” said Mr. Hammond.
“Those big cities want to see the ship, and
really it is their right to do so. No, we will
make as good time as we can on our predetermined
course.” He walked aft.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gee, the Big Fella’s low!” said Red, looking
after him. “But only a few hours more,
and we will be ready for him. They promised
to deliver those screws by nine-thirty. It
won’t take half an hour then to finish installing
them. Look here, don’t you mean to tell
the chief at all?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not until we hang over Lakehurst; and
not then, if it’s a flop.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come and get a sody while we wait,” suggested
Red. “You are nervous.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why wouldn’t I be?” demanded David.</p>

<p class='c006'>The passengers commenced to wander back;
the crew gathered, and went to their places;
the usual dense crowd blackened the landing
field. Dulcie, still tired, had the peaceful sensation
of returning home. Her father, for
the first time since the ship started from
Lakehurst, showed a strain. It hurt him to
lose the distinction of making a record, but
he had definitely given up the hope of doing
so. David’s seeming unconcern hurt him a
little, but he supposed David was too young
to take such things much to heart.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ship took off without accident, the
ground crew working with the smooth
accuracy of a machine. It was eleven
twenty-five of Friday, July second. They
started eastward through the crystalline,
clean air of California—air which always
carries its own celestial aroma; a perfume,
vague and delicate, made of millions of
flowers, seas of fruit, leagues of pines, all
washed with the faint breath of the sea.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In point of fact,” said Doctor Sims,
judicially, “the enthusiasm of the Californian
seems perfectly justifiable. I was rather
annoyed at first by what I thought was the
bombastic attitude of our barker. But the
young man, while enthusiastic, was really
quite moderate in his statements.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Decidedly,” agreed Doctor Trigg. “I was
recently offered a chair at Leland Stanford
University. I hesitated to accept it, but I believe
it would be a fine place for an old man to
finish his career.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Gr-r-r-r-r-uh!” said Doctor Sims in his
worst growl. “Wild goose chase, I’d call it!
Perfect nonsense! At your age, crazy! New
climate, new type of students. How do you
know how it would affect your lumbago?
Silly, plain silly!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Possibly! Possibly!” Doctor Trigg agreed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dulcie was looking out of the window.
“Aren’t we going rather fast?” she queried,
as a couple of the reporters came up.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We are,” said the younger. “We just
looked at the indicator thing, and we are buzzing
along at a great rate.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I must go and see,” said Dulcie, hurrying
into the control room, where David held the
wheel.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What are we making, Davie?”</p>

<p class='c006'>David beamed. “Ninety miles an hour!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, David!” Dulcie studied him curiously.
“Isn’t that pretty fast for us?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Pretty good clip,” said David carelessly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Does daddy know?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t believe so,” said David. “He hasn’t
been around for quite a while.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, he ought to know,” declared daddy’s
own child.</p>

<p class='c006'>She went off, and almost immediately Mr.
Hammond appeared. He said nothing, but
went to the indicator and studied it. “What’s
wrong with this indicator?” he asked finally.
“We never make that speed.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It has held that, according to the chart,
ever since we left Los Angeles,” said David.
There was a tremor in his voice, that he could
scarcely control. “If it only works, if it only
works!” his heart kept whispering.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If it only works!” he said when Red came
forward to look at the indicator.</p>

<p class='c006'>Red gave him a look of disgust.</p>

<p class='c006'>“If it works! Why, it is working, you
dumb-bell! Ninety! Has the commander seen
it? Well, when are you going to tell him?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“When we reach Lakehurst,” said David.
“I want to work it out. It is only fair to me to
do that.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s your funeral,” sighed Red, “and I’ll
not say a word, but my, wouldn’t I enjoy it
just to break the glad news to him!”</p>

<p class='c006'>From then on the dial gradually grew to be
the center of a group of amazed and delighted
officers. It climbed to ninety-one, wavered,
went to ninety-three, ninety-four and steadied
at ninety-five miles an hour.</p>

<p class='c006'>David called down to the five eggs by telephone,
and the engineers declared that the
engines were working as usual, with no extra
expenditure of gas.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before Saturday dawned they were rushing
over Texas. Soon El Paso was beneath
them, then she faded away. At twelve-thirty,
Kansas City, secure on the border line of two
states, greeted them with bells, whistles and
bombs. Then the yelling crowds, standing on
roofs and blocking thoroughfares, and the
inevitable escort of flitting planes, were behind
them. At seven that evening, going
ninety-eight miles an hour, they passed Chicago,
the city roaring back at their roaring
engines.</p>

<p class='c006'>At eleven Detroit appeared, her forests of
chimneys belching flames of greeting, while
hundreds of brazen factory whistles screeched
their welcome.</p>

<p class='c006'>No one on the ship thought of bed. The
passengers, crowded into the salon, watched
the calm starlit night, listened to the thunder
of the engines, and talked. At twelve the
myriad lights of Cleveland appeared, crossed
and recrossed below them, like chains of diamonds
and fire opals. Searchlights caught
and held them, a dozen airplanes darted up
and played about them. Then the calm and
the darkness again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Beautiful! Beautiful!” said Doctor Trigg,
as he watched the twinkling light-jewels disappear,
and the planes turn back.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Um!” said Doctor Sims. “Trigg, I can’t
just see the advisability of this Leland Stanford
affair. Is the salary larger?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, I’d forgotten it,” said Doctor Trigg.
“Yes, they pay very generously.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“So does Princeton,” said Doctor Sims,
loyally.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course; of course! Well, I haven’t made
up my mind.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I can’t advise for it,” repeated Doctor
Sims. He cleared his throat, and said
rather forlornly, “Fact is, Trigg, I’d miss you.
I—I—actually can’t see it, Trigg.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Doctor Trigg turned and regarded the
gnarled and puckered old face. To him it
looked a fine and open countenance, sincere
and true. He patted the thin shoulder.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Old friend,” he said, “if I go, you go. Did
you think for a minute that I could leave my
old friend after forty years? No, no! I
couldn’t get along without you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Doctor Sims groped for the other’s hand,
and shook it hard. A look of relief filled his
face.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hah—gr-r-r-r-rumph!” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Exactly!” said Martin Trigg.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c007'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br />PARTNERS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>At two A. M. they were over Ayre, Ohio.
The lateness of the hour made no difference
in their welcome. Apparently all the able-bodied
persons in the city had decided to make
a night of it, and most of them had come out
to the landing field to greet the silver ship.
Big searchlights and hundreds of flares surrounded
the field. The mast wore a crown of
colored lights. Just as they reached the field,
all lights were extinguished long enough to
display the words “Welcome, Moonbeam” laid
out on the ground in electric letters six feet
in height.</p>

<p class='c006'>They flew so low that the watching throngs
could see the passengers waving. The engines
were stopped, and they hung for a minute in
the white glare. They could hear, as once
before, the crowd roaring a greeting to their
own ship. “Moonbeam! Moonbeam!” rose the
cry. Then darkness swallowed them again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“David,” said Red, “you just gotta tell Mr.
Hammond.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t see it,” said David, stubbornly.
“Think what a surprise it will be for him
when we reach Lakehurst. We are bound to
make the record he wants. I want you to tune
her up to a hundred miles now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Red leaned against the bench, twirling the
screw on his wrench.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Look, David, if you do that, he’ll think
you’ve held out on him. I would in his place.
He knows all about the accelerator. Don’t
you think he naturally wants to try it out,
too? After all, Dave, he’s the chief—the
commander of this ship, and he’s treated you
darned white.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are right, of course,” said David after
a long pause, reluctantly. “I sort of wanted
to make him a present of the record at Lakehurst,
but you are right.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“He’s in the salon,” said Red. “I’ll get him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As Mr. Hammond came into the control
room, he stopped to look at the indicator.</p>

<p class='c006'>“At this rate,” he said hopefully, “we will
make our record after all. Did you want to
see me, David?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If Van Arden will take the wheel, I’d like
to ask you to come to my room; or perhaps
you want to turn in now, sir?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Turn in!” exclaimed the chief. “With
those engines picking up like this, and cities
to greet every little while—our last night, and
all? Good Lord, no! Never was so wide-awake
in my life.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We feel like that too,” said David.</p>

<p class='c006'>Calling Van Arden, the three went to
David’s stateroom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“All right, David,” said Mr. Hammond,
lighting a cigar.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Shoot!” said Red firmly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, commander, when we recovered the
plans, Red and I decided to have a set of the
accelerators constructed in Los Angeles, and
try them out as we crossed the States. They
couldn’t do any harm, and—”</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond waved away details.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You mean they are on the engines now?”
he demanded. “Is that why we are making
such good time?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I hope so,” said David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You know so, you nut,” said Red, angrily.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond’s cigar went out.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So your accelerator is actually a success.
I thought those plans looked pretty practical.
Can we continue the present speed, do you
think?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, sir, and Red is going now to speed the
adjustment up to a hundred miles an hour.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Go ahead, Red,” laughed Mr. Hammond,
rubbing his hands delightedly. “Don’t let me
keep you!”</p>

<p class='c006'>After Red had gone, opening his wrench
with the pleased air of a man sharpening a
carving knife for a particularly juicy-looking
turkey, Mr. Hammond turned to David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, son, you have certainly won your
spurs. By the way you have handled the ship,
and now by making the record I wanted so
much.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We aren’t there yet,” said David cautiously.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are Scotch, aren’t you?” laughed Mr.
Hammond. “I congratulate you, David, with
all my heart. It is wonderful, absolutely wonderful!
I’m as proud of you as though you
were my own boy. Where are those specifications?
I want to look them over again.
David, I’m certainly delighted.” He shook
hands heartily, as David, with a light heart,
handed him the envelope.</p>

<p class='c006'>Red joined David in the control room later.
He was laughing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Confess now, David, that it would have
been a black deal to leave the Big Fella out in
the dark any longer. I met him just now.
He’s crazy glad. The engineers are havin’ a
celebration, too. In every egg they are all
leanin’ over their engines, oiling and wiping
and testing, for fear she might slow down.
And they are all remindin’ each other that
they are personal friends of the famous Captain
Ellison of the good ship Moonbeam. This
must be Newcastle coming,” he added, dodging
David’s left. “It is three o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As they passed over, Mr. Hammond came
in and peered at the indicator.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She’s making one hundred and ten miles!”
he said shakily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s all right, sir,” laughed David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come to my room; I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He closed the door, and motioned David to
a seat.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ve been figuring this thing out, and I
want to make you an offer. I have made out
a rough agreement for you to sign unless, of
course, you want to consult a lawyer.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll say not, sir,” said David decidedly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here’s my idea, then. See how you like it.
You will take the invention and enter it in the
school contest, but with ‘patents pending’ all
over it. The prize money to be yours. But
before that—now, in fact, I will buy a half interest
in it. I bought back Cram’s shares in
the Moonbeam, you know, and I will make
over those shares to you, in payment. As for
the royalties, we will go fifty-fifty. One other
matter—” he hesitated. “I’d like to share in
this in another way, David. It’s sort of
kiddish, perhaps, but I’d like to see my name—I’d
like to announce it as the Ellison-Hammond
Accelerator.”</p>

<p class='c006'>David took a deep breath.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hammond-Ellison, and you are too generous,
sir.” He held out his hand, and they
shook solemnly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good!” said Mr. Hammond. He laughed
and pointed to the paper. “Sign on the dotted
line,” he quoted, “but think it over first. And
now let’s see if Ryan has juggled us up any
faster.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Moonbeam was holding steadily at one
hundred and ten, and David wanted to talk to
Red. Search discovered him in his quarters,
playing with the kitten. He jumped up,
letting Trouble slide down his leg.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Anything up?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Nothing at all. That is, there’s a lot,”
David stuttered.</p>

<p class='c006'>Red took a step toward the door.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, cool off, the ship’s all right. Sit
down.” David repeated his conversation with
Mr. Hammond, and added, “Now, Red, old
dear, that goes. But with one big IF. If you
and I go fifty-fifty on the prize money, and
fifty-fifty on my share of the royalties. If you
will agree to that I will make the deal with
the commander.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No,” said Red promptly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” said David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, I tell you! What an idea! He invents
a wonderful contraption. It’s a great success;
so he hands out half the royalties to
somebody, mind you,” Red declared scornfully,
“who has just stood around and
admired.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have helped me all along,” declared
David. “I couldn’t have done half so well
without you. Honest, Red, you have got to
do it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“God bless you for a generous imbecile, but
I won’t do it. Come on down, if you won’t let
a poor working man get an hour’s sleep.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have got to go halves with me,” David
persisted doggedly. “Say you will, and you
can go to bed for a couple of hours.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then I sit up,” said Red. “Tell you what,
David! Here’s what you can do, and it will
mean a lot more than money to me. You can
see to it that I get a job with you. I like you,
boy, and we hit it off. Let’s stick together.
Huh?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Surest thing in the world! But the other
goes, too.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No,” said Red.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh Lord!” groaned David.</p>

<p class='c006'>Still arguing, they went down to the passenger
gondola. Bellefontaine was below them,
and it was half-past four.</p>

<p class='c006'>By eight-thirty Sunday morning they were
over New York City. The ship was all excitement.
The passengers looked down with awe
at the majestic city, at its soaring towers and
deep canyons, at its embracing rivers running
to the sea, where the ships of all the world
come laden to the wharves. The sun blazed
on gilded domes and delicate spires, Liberty
lifted her steadfast torch, and the Moonbeam
turned her proud form toward Lakehurst.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the control room the operator met Red
with a radiogram.</p>

<p class='c006'>“From the Padre, I suppose. Do you know,
he never answered that telegram I sent him
from Los Angeles?” Red commented, opening
the message. He read the words over and
over, as though disbelieving his eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” he said at last, “the thing that just
couldn’t happen has happened. Read it!”</p>

<p class='c006'>David took the paper. It read:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Insist on seeing you at Lakehurst stop
most important stop grandfather’s farm has
let loose with two gushers best grade oil stop
worth millions.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, that’s immense!” cried David.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, it’s the grand news,” said Red. “That
farm! It wouldn’t grow anything but tarantulas
and scorpions and prairie dogs. Two
gushers! Now mother, God bless her, can
have all her heart desires, and the Padre can
build himself a whole row of hospitals for his
poor. Ain’t it grand, David? I’m askin’
you!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s the finest thing I ever heard. But
what will you do?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Stick to me engines,” said Red, “forever
and ever. And pray that Old Foolish here will
now stop tantalizin’ me about royalties.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As they walked back through the salon,
they found the radio man talking to the
youngest reporter, who stepped up.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What’s this, Mr. Ryan? I guess you have
a story for me, haven’t you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Not any,” said Ryan.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, sure you have—that message.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Red laughed. “Well, it’s luck I came along,
if it’s this you mean.” He pulled the paper
from his pocket. “From my brother,” he explained.
“He uses a code. Decoded, it means
that he wants me to go with him in New York
to buy some B. V. D’s, and let’s see—Oh, some
socks! And he wants ’em to look like a
million dollars. It is a good code. You’d
never guess it, would you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Unbelief was stamped on the two faces.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where is your home, Mr. Ryan?” asked
the reporter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Red grinned at the trap. “Ayre,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But when you are not in the air,” persisted
the reporter. Red sauntered toward the
passage. “I’m never anywhere else,” he said
over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Hammond came in from the control
room. “Almost there!” he said. “I have almost
worn that indicator out, looking at it.
But I know we have made the grade.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“We all congratulate you, Mr. Hammond,”
said Doctor Trigg.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We do indeed,” added Doctor Sims.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I have already been approached by Parker’s
Magazine for an article on this journey,”
said Doctor Trigg. “I should like you to
peruse the manuscript before I send it to
them. I want to publish it with your personal
approval.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“And I,” said Doctor Sims, “am about to
finish a valuable monograph on ‘Epitaphs of
the World, Past and Present,’ a book which
contains the fruit of twenty years of search
and selection. I should like to dedicate it,
with an appropriately commendatory inscription,
to your daughter.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“To me?” cried Dulcie, flinging her arms
around Doctor Sims in a quick hug. “How
splendid! Won’t the girls at college be green
with envy?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Doctor Sims looked at her. “My dear,” he
said, “you are kind to accept it. It is all an old
man who loves you has to offer. To write an
appropriate book for you would tax Orpheus
and put Sappho to shame.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are very kind, doctor,” Mr. Hammond
replied; then turning to Dulcie, “My dear, I
want you to pick yourself out a nice little
roadster in New York.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Isn’t daddy a dear?” asked Dulcie of the
world at large.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have earned it,” said Mr. Hammond,
and went into the control room to gloat once
more over the speed indicator.</p>

<p class='c006'>Doctor Trigg led Dulcie over to a window.
“I want to add a word, dear child,” he said.
“I want to thank you for what you have done
for two old men. You have shared your youth
and freshness with us. You have opened the
portal into a new world, for Sims and for me.
You have unlocked a door leading into the
secret place of my heart. I had thought that
it was full of ashes, but I find that it is still
peopled by loving and lovely ghosts, who are
glad to accept me again.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, dear Doctor Trigg,” murmured Dulcie,
squeezing his arm.</p>

<p class='c006'>A shout from Mr. Hammond interrupted
them, attracting the attention of everyone.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Lakehurst in sight,” he cried. “Around
the world in nineteen days, and eight hours!
Ahead of the flying time of the Graf Zeppelin,
and in a much larger ship.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The reporters cheered lustily. Everyone
rushed to shake the commander’s hand. Dulcie,
with Koko under her arm, went and stood
by David at the wheel.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We will soon be there, Captain Ellison.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes indeed, Miss Hammond,” he answered,
smiling.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Look down, David. The place is black with
people. Aren’t there acres of cars over
there?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Many more than when we left,” said
David. “A terrible mob. It would be, you
know. It is the Fourth of July, and the world
and his wife and the kiddies are here to see us
finish the cruise. Just look at them! I hope
they can keep the field clear. Take this glass.
See the flags, and the mobs on the buildings
outside the field. Enthusiasm! Why, they’re
crazy! What they won’t do to us!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It scares me somehow,” said Dulcie. “I’d
like to stay right here.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, the first flight of the silver ship is
ended,” David mused, as he guided his ship
over the field. “I wonder what her next will
be. So many things have happened.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The Moonbeam has brought you fame and
fortune, hasn’t she, David?”</p>

<p class='c006'>David did not answer. The great ship
hovered above the field, then slowly sank, the
landing crew in full formation beneath her.
Down and down, slowly, gracefully until her
ropes were seized by eager, practiced hands.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She’s brought me something better than
fame and fortune;” said David, suddenly,
answering Dulcie’s question. “Hammond-Ellison:
partners. Does that stand, Dulcie?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Her eyes met his.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It certainly stands,” she said.</p>
